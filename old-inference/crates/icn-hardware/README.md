# icn-hardware

The optional `icn-model-assessment` diagnostic binary runs the exact `common_get_device_memory_data` and `common_fit_params` implementation from
the llama.cpp revision nested in our bindings fork. It reads GGUF metadata and builds no-allocation
graphs, but does not load model tensor data. This makes it suitable for admission checks before an
ICN loads a model.

```sh
cargo run --manifest-path old-inference/Cargo.toml -p icn-hardware --bin icn-model-assessment -- \
  --model /absolute/path/to/model.gguf
```

The JSON report contains the requested and selected context/GPU layers, tensor splits and overrides,
per-device model/context/compute estimates, margins and deficits, plus typed adjustments and
warnings. Flags for context, batching, sequence count, KV types, Flash Attention, KV offload, SWA,
and unified KV must match the context ICN intends to create.

## Boundaries of the pinned estimator

The report is a planner estimate, not observed peak RSS or runtime allocation. The pinned upstream
implementation does not account for a multimodal projector, draft/MTP model, other models already
loaded by ICN, transient model-load allocations, or an OS reserve beyond the supplied margins. It
also assumes host memory is unlimited whenever an accelerator is present. Device free memory is a
point-in-time reading, and integrated/unified-memory backends may report the same physical pool in
more than one role.

ICN normalizes those raw reports before exposing or evaluating them. In particular, Apple Silicon
has one OS-sized unified physical-memory domain shared by CPU and Metal. Metal's backend-reported
capacity is retained as a recommended working-set constraint, not added as a second pool. A `Fits`
result must satisfy both the unified physical capacity and every applicable device constraint.
Outside Apple platforms, exact backend device identities merge aliases of the same physical
accelerator, and integrated-GPU allocations share the host-memory domain.

`common_fit_params` returns only success/failure/error; its detailed native diagnostic is emitted to
the llama logger and is not a structured API. We intentionally do not scrape that text. Exceptions
from the initial and selected structured measurement calls are retained as diagnostics.
