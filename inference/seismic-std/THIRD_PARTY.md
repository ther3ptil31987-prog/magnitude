# Third-party numerical code

`lib/kernels/gelu.seismic` adapts the error-function rational
approximations in rust-lang/libm 0.2.16, `src/math/erff.rs`, originating from
FreeBSD msun `s_erff.c`. The adaptation expresses the work as portable Seismic
and uses a bounded arithmetic truncation for the tail exponent split.
