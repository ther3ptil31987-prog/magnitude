//! Tuning at program preparation (route spec NR12, program spec E6, tuning
//! spec `specs/26-09-24/native-tuning-search-and-caching.md`).
//!
//! Every native entry whose implementation declares tuning parameters is
//! tuned on the opened device on the first load for each tuning key. A count
//! walk finds the units that will search; each then searches the declared
//! domain within its launches' share of [`TUNING_TIME`], building each
//! point's inputs only when Seismic admits the point, and forming,
//! measuring and validating what it reaches. With a [`KernelCache`], each
//! result is stored under a key over what it is valid for (tuning version,
//! device and toolchain identity, unit, implementation digest, precision
//! policy and served shapes). Nothing is shipped.
//! The engine supplies what only it knows, per entry, through an
//! [`EntryTuning`] case:
//!
//! - static values from model geometry;
//! - tuning points over the shape classes the entry serves (§5.3), with
//!   weights;
//! - rotations built from real resident weights of up to
//!   [`ROTATION_LAYERS`] distinct layers, so repeated calls stream from
//!   memory as a real step does;
//! - control tables built as the batch builder builds them
//!   ([`TuningInputs::batch`]);
//! - scratch state, KV history and routing tables owned by each case. An
//!   entry's `&mut` parameters bind [`CaseState`]s, whose complete contents are
//!   restored before each reference and validated invocation (Seismic's
//!   `TuningPoint::initialize`); real state is never bound.
//!
//! Each entry uses the compiler precision policy with explicit floating result/state limits.
//!
//! Adding an entry: implement [`EntryTuning`] for a case type in the module of
//! its block family, and prepare the entry through `Specializer::tuned` at
//! its preparation call site. An entry that declares parameters but is
//! prepared through `Specializer::fixed` fails preparation with a typed error
//! naming it.
//!
//! Entries sharing element bindings, static values and model weight groups can
//! reuse matching numerical evidence; equal geometry alone never authorizes reuse.

/// Implements [`EntryTuning::tune`] and [`EntryTuning::entry`] through an
/// entry module's generated `native_tune[_with]` and
/// `native_entry[_with]`. `$this => $elements` names the case and the
