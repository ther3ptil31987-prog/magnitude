//! How one preparation's tuning time is divided among its units.
//!
//! The time is planned before it is spent, so that tuning ends inside it
//! because the planned work fits, not because work was cut off.
//!
//! Breadth comes before depth. Every unit is first started, the unit with
//! the largest share of step time first: its defaults are measured, and its
//! form starts when the plan has room. Each unit states what its start will
//! cost: its planning and measurements, and the programs it must form. The
//! plan prices a program at what forming one has taken so far in this
//! preparation (a cold pipeline cache shows up here) and scales the units'
//! own estimates by how the starts so far compared with theirs. A unit
//! gets its form starts while they fit together with a defaults-only start
//! and the conclusion of every unit after it; else a defaults-only start
//! while that fits; else it waits. The plan is made again before each
//! start, from what the starts before it took.
//!
//! A unit that waits is not dropped. The plan is made again for the units
//! waiting, largest share first, before every later step: a start that did
//! not fit can fit once the starts after it have shown what a start costs
//! against its estimate, or once a conclusion has given back what it left
//! of its reserve. Such a unit is started then, and being the unit that has
//! received the least for its weight it is refined before the others. Only
//! a unit whose start never fit keeps its defaults unmeasured.
//!
//! The breadth is finished first: a unit started on its defaults alone is
//! owed its form starts, and gets the step that measures them, largest
//! share first, before any slice is dealt by weight (a search of three
//! configurations is ended there whatever its share).
//!
//! The time left is then dealt in slices to the units whose searches are
//! not finished, by the step time each still takes: a unit's share of step
//! time at its defaults times its best cost so far relative to them, which
//! is what further search can recover. What one of a unit's measurements
//! costs takes no part: a unit whose measurements are slow (long prefill
//! points, programs slow to form) gets its share of the time and fewer
//! measurements in it, not less time for each of them. Each slice goes to
//! the unit that with it will have received the least time per unit of that
//! weight, so the units' time follows it from the first slice on (a unit of
//! a hundredth of the step is not refined before the unit of a quarter of
//! it has had twenty-five slices, and a round of first slices does not eat
//! the time on a device whose every step is slow), a unit that overruns a
//! slice waits for the others to catch up, and the time a finished unit
//! does not need goes to the rest.
//!
//! Every started unit can be concluded (its finalists confirmed, its choice
//! validated) within its reserve, its own estimate of that cost. A reserve
//! is a bound, not what the conclusion takes: a unit with nothing to
//! confirm concludes in no time. So when the time left only covers the
//! reserves of the units not yet concluded, one unit is concluded, the one
//! that has received the most for its weight, and what its conclusion left
//! of its reserve goes back to the others, which are refined on; and so on
//! until every unit is concluded, the last when the time left covers only
//! its own reserve. A unit whose search finishes is concluded at once.
//!
//! A slice is dealt only while what a unit cannot interrupt still fits
//! before the reserves: the longest a refinement of any unit has run past
//! its slice (a chunk's programs being formed and measured). A step that
//! runs into the reserves takes the time of the conclusions after it, and
//! a conclusion without its time gives up its choice. The first refinement
//! of a unit started on its defaults alone measures its form starts
//! whatever the slice: that step is held to the plan's price of those
//! starts instead, and says nothing of the slices after it.
//!
//! Under the plan lies a guarantee: every step is given the instant by
//! which it must return with what it has. A step that reaches it, or ends
//! after it, is a failure of the plan, and is reported as one.
