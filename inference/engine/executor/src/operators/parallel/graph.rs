//! A dense branch beside a general routed branch (Gemma 4 26B,
//! [`DenseBesideRouted`]). Both branches read the same residual
//! through their own input norms: the dense branch's gated expansion is
//! projected down into F32 rows, and the routed branch sums its experts onto
//! zeros. `moe_tail` normalizes each branch with its output norm, normalizes
//! their sum with the sublayer's post-norm, and adds it to the residual
//! (times the layer scale of a scaled tail).
