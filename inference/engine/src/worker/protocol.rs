//! The private host/worker protocol (integration spec §8.1).
//!
//! Only immutable, device-free values cross: the execution manifest, prepared
//! numerical input, generation options and the constraint *description*
//! (`ConstraintPlan`); the worker instantiates the matcher with its own
//! vocabulary. Output flows back under per-request credit: the host grants one
//! batch of credit per output batch its consumer drains, and the worker drains
//! the engine's bounded publication queue only while it holds credit, so a slow
//! consumer backs up to the engine's publication bound.
//!
//! The encoding (serde) is versioned with the engine build: both ends
//! exchange [`EngineBuild`] first and refuse a mismatch.
