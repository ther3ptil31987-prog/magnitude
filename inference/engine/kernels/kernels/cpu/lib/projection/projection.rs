// The projection library of the CPU entries: the operand prologues (the RMS
// normalization of a residual row, the staging of an activation row as F32)
// and the row-block driver over a weight operand's dot components. The
// counterpart of `metal/lib/projection/projection.h`,
// `cuda/lib/projection/projection.cuh` and
// `vulkan/lib/projection/projection.glsl`, with the same vocabulary.
//
// Decomposition: a projection launch gives each work item a block of weight
// rows (at most 8, one dot-component call per activation row), which it
// projects against every activation row of the call. The block's weights stay
// in cache across the activation rows, and activation rows are staged as F32
// once per call by a separate launch, never per work item.
//
// Numerics: the portable `linear` accumulates `x[k] * w[k]` in F32; the dot
// components accumulate the same products in a fixed lane order, the
// reassociation every native backend is qualified under.
