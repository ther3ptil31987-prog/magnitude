//! The worker pool of one CPU device: its participants, job publication,
//! work-item claiming, and the barriers participants meet at.
//!
//! The pool has one participant per physical performance core
//! ([`Workers::host`]). The submitting thread is participant 0 and works
//! alongside the pool's threads (participants 1..): a job runs on every
//! participant and the submitter returns once every participant has left
//! it, so the frame, buffer table, words and scratch the job borrows stay
//! valid for its duration.
//!
//! Two kinds of job run on the pool:
//!
//! - one compiled launch ([`Workers::run`]): participants form teams of the
//!   launch's workgroup thread count; each team claims workgroups from the
//!   launch's counter, its members running one thread of the workgroup each;
//! - a sequence of authored native launches ([`Workers::run_native`]): every
//!   participant walks the steps in order; a step's participants (at most
//!   its item count) claim its work items from its counter and meet the next
//!   step's participants at a barrier after it. A whole native graph
//!   therefore wakes the pool once.
//!
//! Waiting participants spin for a short, fixed bound and then park. Job
//! state, counters and scratch are owned by the pool and reused.
