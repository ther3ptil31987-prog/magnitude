//! Device timing of a prepared native implementation at one or more
//! workloads ("points"), each cycling through its own argument sets.
//!
//! A point's calls are validated and placed once; every sample resubmits
//! them. Timing is device time (command-buffer timestamps on Metal, stream
//! events on CUDA), so host latency never enters a sample. Each sample
//! completes before the next is submitted: a Metal queue runs command
//! buffers without a hazard between them concurrently, so samples of
//! different points submitted back to back overlap and each one's interval
//! includes the other's work (measured on an M4 Pro, 2026-09-24: a decode
//! GEMV's samples read 185 µs next to a 4-row point's and 67 µs alone).
//!
//! The first pass over a point's rotation calibrates the repetitions per
//! sample so that a sample covers at least `min_sample_seconds` of device
//! time. The first pass of a kernel pays its first-use device costs and is
//! never a sample; a later point's calibrating pass of the same kernel is one
//! when it already covers a steady sample.
//!
//! Repeated samples average out a sample's fixed jitter. A sample of at
//! least [`STEADY_SAMPLE_SECONDS`] holds that jitter to a small fraction of
//! any margin that ranks configurations, so such a point takes one sample.
//!
//! A device that idled (while configurations were formed, for example) runs
//! at a low clock until it has been busy for a while: on an M4 Pro the first
//! configuration measured after forming a batch read 2–4× its time for its
//! first 4–15 samples, and sometimes for all of them; a unit of small
//! kernels on an M4 Max read about 4× its time for every configuration of a
//! batch. So a device idle for more than [`IDLE`] since its last timed work
//! is first [`warm`]ed: kept busy until its speed stops changing.
