//! Submission tracing for measurement. While a trace is active on a device,
//! every native submission on that device is recorded with its host encode
//! interval and, once complete, its device interval on the same host clock.
//! At launch detail each launch runs in its own timed unit (Metal encoder,
//! CUDA event pair, Vulkan timestamp pair), so device time is attributed to
//! entries; that changes the device work and is for attribution runs only.
