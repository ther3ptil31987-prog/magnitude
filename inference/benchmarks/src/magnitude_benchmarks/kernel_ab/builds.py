"""Engine measurement tools built from a git revision or the working tree.

A revision builds in a persistent worktree with its own Cargo target directory, so moving it to
another revision rebuilds incrementally. The working tree builds in place. Each build's binaries
are copied to a directory named by its identity, which is what a run records.

Both sides measure with the same tools: the harness checkout's measurement examples replace the
revision's before it builds, so a comparison never mixes two versions of the measurement itself.
