# Service

**One request owner, one physical batch in flight. Prefill and decode time-share;
capacity is negotiated with the model's own prices, never with its layout.**

## Lifecycle

```text
                          admit
Queued ── selected ──► Runnable ──► Completion (batch in flight) ──► Runnable …
                          │                                              │
                          ├── output queue full ──► Output (until drained)│
                          ├── evicted ──► Preempted ──► replay ──────────┘
                          ├── no capacity, peers may change it ──► Capacity (until the epoch moves)
                          └── stop / length / context / cancel / failure ──► Terminal
```

Status is derived from facts, never stored; a request is in exactly one of these
states at any time. The transport drives `step`, waits on the returned
completion, and drains output. Idle service does nothing until something changes.

## Selecting a phase

Under contention (both prefill and decode candidates exist) decode runs first,
then prefill accrues **decode debt** at the configured share `s`:

Phase cost includes preparation through observed completion. Preparation can
overlap numerical execution, so it cannot be discarded when charging time or
ranking accumulated service. Reported preparation and the remaining completion
interval partition that wall time; neither is a native GPU duration.

```text
prefill lasting p:   debt += p × s / (1 − s)
decode lasting d:    debt −= d
prefill eligible:    debt ≤ 0

equal shares, 40 ms prefill, 10 ms decode rounds:
[D:10][P:40][D:10][D:10][D:10][D:10][P:40] …     debt 40 → 30 → 20 → 10 → 0
```

Without contention the eligible phase runs without throttling, and contention
accounting resets when contention ends: idle time earns no credit against future
arrivals. Within a phase, priority is waiting time plus a locality credit for
requests that are active, resident, or carrying preemption debt, then least
service, so a resident request is not pushed out by a newcomer of equal age.

## Capacity

Preparation asks the model boundary to claim the logical and physical capacity
needed by one tentative batch. When it cannot, the service negotiates in a fixed
order, each step cheaper than the next in lost work. It reasons about prices and
releasable bytes, never tensor layouts or allocation kinds:

| Step | What it costs |
|---|---|
| Reclaim: ask owners to retire unclaimed temporary capacity and idle caches | Nothing already paid for |
| Drop the last selected request from the batch | That request waits a step |
| Halve the actual multi-token allowance, including forced decode | Smaller chunks repeat execution overhead |
| Evict victims priced by the model | Their prompts are replayed |
| Block until the service epoch changes | Wait for a peer to finish, publish or cancel |
| Fail with the required and available bytes | Nothing else can change the answer |

A physical shape that already failed is never retried; a soft allowance cannot
split an indivisible input span, so when shrinking would only repeat the shape,
eviction is tried instead. Victims are chosen output-blocked first, then least
preemption debt, then most exclusive bytes per replayed input, then least
service; a victim carries debt that protects it from being chosen again until it
has caught up. Eviction counts only if the budget actually fell.

## Epochs

Every event that could change what is feasible advances the epoch: an admission,
a completion, a publication, a cancellation, a retirement. A request blocked on
capacity is retried only after the epoch moves, so a full engine does not spin.

## Accounting

A batch's elapsed time is one cost, attributed equally to its requests by the
phase they were in. Emitted tokens are not a clock. Preparation, submission and
execution failures are attributed to the requests in the batch and keep their
accepted output; a failed execution owner fails every live request at once.

## Consequences

Decode-first contention keeps generating requests responsive at the cost of a
newcomer's first token. FIFO admission can leave queued requests behind long
residents. Time sharing controls this engine's own contention; it neither promises
a per-request latency nor governs other users of the device.
