# Portable kernels

**A kernel is an authored portable TileLang schedule within an operation.
Ops defines the physical implementation; TileLang owns its compiler
meaning and target-specific realization.**

[Kernel optimization](development/kernel-optimization.md) defines how schedules
are pushed to their limits without weakening this boundary.

## Boundary

```text
semantic operation or region
        │ Ops chooses algorithm, strategy and static parameters
        ▼
portable T.Kernel emission
        │ Ops assembles the maximal compilation unit
        ▼
TileLang module
        │ TileLang lowers the whole unit for the target
        ▼
native executable
```

Ops kernels use only the public TileLang language. They do not call a
target function, pass target-specific compiler flags, inspect generated IR or
branch on a backend name. TileLang and TVM values remain inside the kernel and
runtime packages and never cross Ops's public tensor API.

## Target-aware portability

Portable does not mean one schedule for every device. Ops chooses a physical
strategy using tensor shapes, representations and resolved resource budgets.
TileLang owns the actual lowering and schedule tuning; Ops has no competing
backend catalogue or tuning registry.

Resource limits come from the compilation target and its explicitly selected
execution device. Missing information is unknown rather than zero capacity.
Explicit and offline targets retain their constraints.

Ops authors work-tile sizes, reduction steps, operand storage and thread counts.
TileLang selects instructions and infers layouts for those concrete operations.
No synthetic GEMM probe or instruction inventory gates kernel construction.
Numerical qualification checks the resulting program; a storage dtype alone
does not establish arithmetic precision.

Strategies are named by their computation and data movement. Backend-specific
realization stays in TileLang. Unsupported operations are diagnosed by their
compiler or execution interface rather than inferred from a general feature list.

## Construction and compilation

A selected region contributes an ordinary Python emitter that calls statically
authored TileLang schedules. The compiler creates the ordered parameter plan and
binds region operands to graph values. The TileLang adapter passes that dynamic
ABI and a Python body callback to its public eager builder; the callback invokes every
selected emitter in dependency order while TileLang's eager builder is active.

This is programmatic IR construction, not source generation. Kernel bodies are
real Python checked and refactored with the rest of the codebase. Ops does
not concatenate strings, invoke `exec`, synthesize Python signatures, or reach
through TileLang to TIR builders.

A true fusion has one `T.Kernel` region and no globally materialized interior.
An algorithm with required device-wide phases may use several ordered
`T.Kernel` regions in one authored schedule function. Ops never recovers,
clones, splices or structurally compares existing PrimFuncs through private TVM
IR.

Already-finalized PrimFuncs are never recovered, cloned or combined. That would
make a region the compilation boundary prematurely and require private compiler
IR. Composition occurs from the selected lowerings through TileLang's public
programmatic `PrimFunc` and `IRModule` construction. Formula boundaries and
operand planning remain entirely Ops concepts.

## Native entrypoint

One compiled multi-function module is one TileLang program, not one device
kernel. TileLang may lower its private schedules' `T.Kernel` regions to several device launches, but
its execution adapter encodes them through one native host entrypoint and one
ordered stream or command-buffer context. A Python loop over device kernels does
not satisfy this contract.

Ops supplies the unit and identifies immutable and dynamic operands.
TileLang owns ABI validation, generic partial binding and the backend-specific
realization of the pre-bound entrypoint. If an adapter cannot provide native
multi-launch or partial binding, the deficiency is a TileLang runtime gap rather
than permission to split the graph into Python calls.

## Numerical invariants

| Invariant | Reason |
|---|---|
| Accumulation and rounding boundaries are explicit | Real-number equivalence does not establish finite-precision equivalence |
| Encoded bits are reinterpreted before explicit decode arithmetic | Storage interpretation cannot be left to compiler accident |
| Padding and peers never enter a row's reduction | Batching and tiling cannot alter the mathematical result |
| State reads and writes match the operation's declared version | Fusion cannot reorder or expose tentative state |
| Unsupported tails are handled or reject applicability | A fast interior kernel is not a complete schedule |

Fusion eliminates storage and launches, not declared publication precision.
When a region covers distinct normalization, activation, multiplication, or
branch-add operations, their logical dtype boundaries remain observable even if
the values never leave registers. Arithmetic internal to a single operation is
governed by that operation's numerical contract, not invented intermediate nodes.

Representation decoding happens where its values are consumed. A quantized
matrix schedule decodes only the tile it reuses; it does not require a resident
dequantized copy unless that representation is selected and charged explicitly.

Small-row projection is selected by shape rather than by the enclosing prefill
or decode label. An exact-row direct schedule avoids executing masked matrix
instruction rows. Consecutive attention or recurrent projections that consume
the same activation form one lowering region and one `T.Kernel`; their separate
semantic outputs remain visible to downstream operations without requiring
separate launches.

Long-context decode attention groups every query head sharing one KV head into
the same partition workgroup. Subgroups scan disjoint history spans, retain
online-softmax state in registers, and reduce each query/key dot within the
subgroup without a workgroup barrier per history token. One bounded shared merge
combines subgroup results, and a second ordered kernel merges partitions.
Prefill uses streaming matrix products with query-row reuse. Scores remain inside
the streaming tile; bounded partial outputs and statistics may be used to combine
history partitions without materializing the score matrix.

Packed projections consume whole representation packets. Decode assigns packet
GEMVs to subgroups. Affine-Q4 decode reuses each activation packet across four
output rows in one subgroup; compatible parallel projections share that packet
even across branch boundaries. Gated decode reuses it across gate/up row pairs.
The row schedule preserves packet arithmetic and output rounding.
Shared affine packet preparation computes the activation sum once and may pair
masked nibble positions with exact reciprocal-power-of-two activation scaling.
It keeps the unscaled path whenever that scaling would introduce an FP32
subnormal; this optimization cannot narrow the input's numerical range.
Prefill unpacks exact integer codes into a shared matrix tile,
then applies each coefficient group as `scale * dot + bias * activation_sum`.
The matrix uses exact stored activations and integer codes; coefficients, sums,
cross-group accumulation and hierarchical GGUF scale products remain FP32.
Gate/up and output publication retain their declared rounding boundaries.
Ordinary, parallel, gated and grouped contractions use one affine tile helper;
shared-memory legality includes its coefficient pairs. Its matrix contraction
uses TileLang's balanced warp policy to share operand reuse across both output
axes rather than forcing every warp onto rows. Runtime row prefixes remain
instruction-row predicates; coefficient reduction ownership remains independent
through the shared row-sum bridge. Embedding publication uses
the same packet decoder with coefficient application, not the raw-code mode.
This regrouping is subject to the unchanged isolated and whole-model numerical
controls; mathematical equivalence alone is not evidence of accepted precision.
Adjacent projections over one activation share a physical grid. Routed
decode combines selected and shared expert gate/up work and their down work into
two kernels. Routed prefill groups routes, combines routed/shared tiled gate/up,
combines their tiled down projections, and performs one final unpermute/shared
reduction.

Long recurrent prefill prepares FP32 chunk-local transformed keys/values and
causal products independently. Its sequential scan only computes residuals and
updates state; it saves incoming chunk states for parallel output computation.
The consumed transformed-value buffer becomes the residual buffer in place.
All three stages and the complete workspace belong to one operation. Shared
capacity and full scratch bytes must fit before using this schedule; boundary
state materialization is explicitly accounted for, not retained prefix state.
Decode and small spans
retain register recurrence. Chunk boundaries are numerical scheduling choices,
not prefix-checkpoint boundaries. Both strategies expose the same output and
final state, preserve empty sequences, and respect reset decays without dividing
by cumulative decay products. Chunk scratch belongs in the ordinary workspace
ledger, and extra device stages remain inside the native program entry.

Sampling distributes large vocabularies into coalesced, chunk-aligned ranges and
merges exact score/token/invalid summaries. Token IDs, not partition coordinates,
address Philox counters; comparison ties always select the smaller token. Any
NaN/+infinity invalidates the row, and an all-masked row remains empty. Small or
workspace-constrained cases use the same scoring/reduction body in one stage.
Scratch and native-launch legality are explicit; a reduction tree uses a legal
power-of-two thread count even when the device's limit is not a power of two.

## Qualification

A kernel change is qualified at the active work plan's validation gate with
independent numerical validation and enclosing-formula measurement. Inspect
generated code when needed to establish the claimed mechanism. Emitting valid
source or improving an isolated instruction loop is insufficient; include the
operation's materializations, I/O, transfers and completion in the comparison.

Target-specific tests belong with TileLang when they validate a capability,
primitive or lowering. Ops tests validate that portable operations and their
target-dependent behavior produce correct, performant execution across the
compilation targets it supports.
