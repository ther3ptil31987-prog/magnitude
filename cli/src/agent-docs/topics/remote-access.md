# Remote access

Magnitude serves its inference API on port 10100 of the computer running it. By default only that computer can reach it.

## Base URLs

- OpenAI-compatible: `http://ADDRESS:10100/inference/v1`
- Anthropic-compatible: `http://ADDRESS:10100/inference/anthropic`

On the same computer, `ADDRESS` is `127.0.0.1` and no API key is needed. Send any value if the client requires one.

## From another device

Enable Network access in Magnitude Settings, or set `network.enabled`, `network.bind`, and `network.apiKey` in `~/.magnitude/config.json` on the server. Use an IP address assigned to the server and a long, randomly generated key. Restart Magnitude after changes. The address can be on a local network or a private network such as Tailscale. Send the key as `Authorization: Bearer KEY` or `x-api-key: KEY`. Only inference is available from other devices; model management and `/rpc` are not.

Check the connection:

```sh
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer KEY" http://ADDRESS:10100/inference/v1/models
```

| Response | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Connection refused | Network access is off, or the chosen address does not include this network. |
| 401 | Missing or changed API key. |
| 421 | Hostname not accepted. Use an IP address, or the user adds the name to `network.allowedHosts` in `~/.magnitude/config.json`. |

## Remote inference server

On the remote computer, run `magnitude serve` and leave that terminal running. Use another SSH
session for commands such as `magnitude models status` and `magnitude models load <model-id>`.

For direct access, enable Network access and use the server address and API key in your client. To connect through SSH without enabling Network access, open a tunnel on your own computer:

```sh
ssh -N -L 10101:127.0.0.1:10100 user@server
```

Keep the tunnel running and use `http://127.0.0.1:10101/inference/v1` locally. No Magnitude API key
is needed through this loopback tunnel. Model management commands still run on the remote computer.
Ctrl+C stops the foreground server. Opening Magnitude Desktop on that computer transfers ownership
to Desktop and ends the foreground command.

An available update never interrupts the server. When it reports a prepared update, stop the server
and run `magnitude serve` again to install it before serving. On Linux, installation can remain
deferred when system authorization is unavailable. Stop the server and run `magnitude update install`
from a terminal to authorize installation or explicitly retry a failed attempt, then start it again.

When using a service manager, configure restart on failure rather than unconditional restart:
successful Desktop takeover ends `serve` normally and should leave it stopped. For a systemd user
service, use `Restart=on-failure` and `KillMode=control-group`. Enable user lingering if the server
must run before login or after logout. A foreground SSH session is not a persistent service;
disconnecting it stops its process tree. Stop the service-manager unit before an explicit update
installation, then start the unit afterward.

## WSL

Inside WSL on Windows, `127.0.0.1` is the Linux distribution, not Windows. With WSL mirrored networking, `http://127.0.0.1:10100` works. Otherwise use the Windows host address from `ip route show default | awk '{print $3}'` with Network access on and the API key.
