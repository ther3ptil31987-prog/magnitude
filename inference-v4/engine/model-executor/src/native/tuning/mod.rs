//! Tuning at program preparation (route spec NR12, program spec E6, tuning
//! spec `specs/26-09-24/native-tuning-search-and-caching.md`).
//!
//! Every native entry whose implementation declares tuning parameters is
//! tuned on the opened device on the first load for each tuning key. Seismic
//! searches the declared domain within a budget (a share of
//! [`MODEL_BUDGET`] among the model's tuning units, counted by a census
//! before tuning), forming, measuring and validating what it reaches. With a
//! [`KernelCache`], each result is stored under a key over everything it
//! depends on (device and toolchain identity, unit, implementation digest,
//! search definition); a later load with the same key prepares the stored
//! choice without forming or measuring anything to tune. Nothing is shipped.
//! The engine supplies what only it knows, per entry, through an
//! [`EntryTuning`] case:
//!
//! - static values from model geometry;
//! - tuning points over the shape classes the entry serves (§5.3), with
//!   weights;
//! - rotations built from real resident weights of up to
//!   [`ROTATION_LAYERS`] distinct layers, so repeated calls stream from
//!   memory as a real step does;
//! - control tables built as the batch builder builds them
//!   ([`TuningInputs::batch`]);
//! - scratch state, KV history and routing tables owned by each case. An
//!   entry's `&mut` parameters bind [`CaseState`]s, whose written region is
//!   restored before each configuration's validation run (Seismic's
//!   `TuningPoint::initialize`); real state is never bound.
//!
//! Every entry shares one validation rule, [`ARITHMETIC_TOLERANCE`].
//!
//! Adding an entry: implement [`EntryTuning`] for a case type in the module of
//! its block family, and prepare the entry through `Specializer::tuned` at
//! its preparation call site. An entry that declares parameters but is
//! prepared through `Specializer::fixed` fails preparation with a typed error
//! naming it.
//!
//! Entries prepared more than once with identical element bindings and static
//! values (the MTP head's blocks share the target's shapes) are tuned once:
//! the tuner reuses the first result.

/// Implements [`EntryTuning::tune`] and [`EntryTuning::prepare`] through an
/// entry module's generated `native_tune[_with]` and
/// `native_for_device[_with]`. `$this => $elements` names the case and the
/// entry's element bindings built from it.
