//! Storage for formed native artifacts, supplied by the embedder.
//!
//! Seismic forms some native implementations with a toolchain at run time
//! (NVRTC for CUDA). An embedder that keeps formed artifacts between
//! processes passes an [`ArtifactStore`] when it opens a device; Seismic
//! computes each artifact's content address and asks the store before
//! forming, and hands it every newly formed artifact. Seismic performs no
//! file I/O and knows no locations: where and how artifacts are kept, and
//! for how long, is the store's concern.
