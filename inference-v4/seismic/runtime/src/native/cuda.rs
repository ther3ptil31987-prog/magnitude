//! CUDA submission of native dispatch lists.
//!
//! A submission of sealed graph runs (one run, or a sequence of runs
//! submitted together) replays a CUDA graph: its launches, with every
//! argument fixed, instantiated once and launched with one driver call. The
//! arguments are the plans' sealed words and geometry plus the addresses of
//! the buffers the runs bind, so the device keeps graphs keyed by the plans
//! and those addresses; a submission binding the same storage as an earlier
//! one replays that submission's graph, and one binding new storage forms a
//! new graph. Per-step values never live in arguments: host-written inputs
//! are written into each run's upload region, which the graph addresses.
//!
//! Standalone calls, and every launch of a launch-detail trace (timed one by
//! one), are launched individually.
