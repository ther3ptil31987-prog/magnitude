# Seismic for VS Code

Local syntax highlighting, comment toggling, bracket matching, indentation, and
folding for `.seismic` files. The grammar covers the logical language surface:
owned and borrowed tensors, bounded `index`/`range` types, ordered `for` and
independent `parallel for`, backend `requires` clauses, and qualified capability
operations such as `metal.matrix.matmul`. Former physical authoring forms are not
highlighted as current source constructs. No compiler or language server is bundled.

From this directory, package and install:

```sh
npx --yes @vscode/vsce package --allow-missing-repository --skip-license
code --install-extension seismic-language-0.0.4.vsix
```

Alternatively, use **Extensions: Install from VSIX...** in VS Code's command
palette and select the generated file. Nothing is published.

To try the source without packaging, run from this directory:

```sh
code --new-window --extensionDevelopmentPath="$PWD"
```

Open a Seismic source file in that window. Colors follow your current theme.
