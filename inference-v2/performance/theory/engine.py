"""Service relaxations use necessary information, never observed overhead.

A complete workload may fuse, overlap and share all legal work. Its resource
relaxation reads each necessary parameter only once. This intentionally loose bound
is stronger only when a workload proves additional causal/residency constraints.
Publication GAP has a zero floor if the contract permits buffering outputs; a
positive bound requires an immediate-publication dependency contract.
