# Model composability

**Models compose computational blocks with explicit contracts. Implementations
can be compared and replaced independently, then fused and compiled together.**

This defines composition within a model executor. The engine coordinates requests;
the executor advances model state and owns the resources needed for that execution.
[Optimization](optimization.md) defines how implementation choices earn their place.
[Kernel construction](../kernels.md) defines numerical building blocks, execution plans
and generated Metal through MLX.
[Component identification](../components.md) defines stable IDs and assembly notation.

The model descriptions are assemblies of identified implementations:
[generic MLX-VLM](architectures/generic-mlx-vlm.md),
[Qwen3.5-family](architectures/qwen35.md), and [Gemma 4](architectures/gemma4.md).
Each tree resolves its nodes to component definitions with contracts, references,
independent checks and performance models. Shared definitions below are authoritative
across those assemblies; family-specific definitions remain in the architecture doc.

## Architecture, block, implementation

An **architecture** defines the model's computation: the arrangement of blocks,
weight interpretation, positional semantics, conditioning and state transitions.
It owns these semantics even when their implementation comes from upstream.

A **block** is a meaningful region of computation with an explicit contract.
Attention, recurrent mixing and feedforward are natural blocks; projection and
preparation or routed expert computation can expose useful nested boundaries.
Boundaries follow behavior and opportunities for reuse or independent comparison,
not every individual tensor operation.

An **implementation** realizes a block's contract using MLX operations, upstream
operators, custom kernels, or a composition of them.

Reusable numerical operations own arithmetic and state-transition behavior. Their
kernel plans own physical execution beneath that boundary. Architectures bind actual
weights and connect operations; they do not assemble Metal source or choose thread tiles.
The same operation can serve multiple architectures when its numerical contract matches.

A compiled resident region binds the same architecture equation and neural components
as scoped execution. State access and resource handling differ; the model's residual
stream and branch ordering have one definition. Its invocation
replaces the corresponding layerwise work; formulation must select the applicable
execution region rather than add both paths' demands.

| Contract property | What must be explicit |
|---|---|
| Computation | Required outputs, mathematical behavior and numerical equivalence requirements |
| Inputs | Weights, activations, positions, conditioning, dtype and layout requirements |
| State | Logical history consumed, state read or advanced, and observable resulting state |
| Support | Valid shapes, quantization formats, execution modes and storage capabilities |
| Lifetime | Mutation and aliasing rules, scratch requirements, and resources needed until device completion |

Replacing an implementation preserves this contract. Different physical state
representations may realize the same logical transition; their storage views and
conversion requirements must be explicit. Unsupported compositions fail during
binding or preparation, before model execution.

## Dependency roles

| Dependency | Role |
|---|---|
| MLX-LM / MLX-VLM | Upstream model execution, artifact compatibility and independent reference computations, exposed through adapters |
| MLX | Tensor representation, device execution, compilation and standard optimized primitives |
| Owned model code | Architecture semantics, block composition and supported implementation selection |
| Owned kernels | Specialized block implementations with demonstrated computational or execution benefits |

Choose the upstream reference for the exact artifact and required capabilities;
record the library and version. Using a second library requires an explicit role
and semantic reconciliation, rather than silently mixing its model conventions.
Upstream loading and selected operators can be reused without adopting upstream
generation loops or cache ownership throughout an optimized model.

Library-specific configuration, module and cache conventions stay at their
adapters. Shared computation depends on explicit tensors and contracts. Architecture
differences such as rotary conventions, normalization or expert routing remain
visible in the owning architecture rather than emerging from incidental imports.

[Input semantics](inputs.md) follow the same boundary: model-owned preparation produces
explicit operands and legal continuation boundaries. The scheduler sees work and
resource requirements; storage sees allocation and visibility; kernels see their
mathematical operands. Adding vision does not introduce family or modality branches
into service policy, speculation, or physical state allocation.

## Composition without execution barriers

```

A block boundary does not require a Python dispatch, GPU launch, synchronization
or materialized intermediate. Adjacent blocks may fuse; a complete resident model
step may compile together. Diagnostic access to a boundary must not impose its
cost on normal execution.

Resource preparation, physical placement and transaction bookkeeping surround
the tensor computation. State storage owns allocation and visibility; blocks
consume compatible views and perform their declared updates. Resources remain
owned until dependent device work completes. Streaming may require explicit
execution segments without moving I/O or residency policy into neural equations.

Lease acquisition reports unavailable capacity before neural work using that lease.
Its factory rolls back on failure. Resource contention identifies the actual blocking
leases: the execution owner may retire their prior consumers and retry acquisition.
It does not synchronize unrelated executions or release a lease held by the current
computation. Unowned or still-busy resources fail explicitly. General allocation
pressure separately permits completion of prior owned work to free memory. Neither
case replays numerical work. Finite streaming banks therefore compose with
asynchronous generation without family-specific scheduling rules.

Prefill, decode and verification share model semantics while allowing different
implementations. Selection follows supported tensor geometry, precision and state
layout within the bound model implementation. [Batching](../engine/batching.md)
supplies compatible work; scheduling does not choose architecture kernels.

Owned one-token decode must preserve each request's numerical operation when batch
membership changes. Sharing weights and input loads is independent of per-request
accumulation; no particular physical request-axis layout is prescribed. Physical placement
and padding must not redefine logical reductions. Wider prefill and verification may use
different qualified algorithms with explicit numerical and continuation-state contracts.

## Independent comparison and reuse

Meaningful block boundaries are invocable by comparison tooling with matched
weights, activations and logical starting state. A fused implementation compares
against the complete upstream region it replaces. Stateful comparisons include
resulting state, not only returned activations.

Comparisons compose from blocks to layers to the full model. Reference adapters
and diagnostic captures belong to validation tooling; production execution does
not require a parallel reference graph.

Share blocks across architectures when their behavior and contracts coincide.
Keep architecture-specific composition and semantic differences explicit. Necessary
specialization stays inside its owner; no universal architecture language or
runtime abstraction is required merely to make computations testable.

## Shared component definitions

Each type below defines its behavior and mathematical assumptions. Executable bindings
are owned by the [performance catalog](../performance.md#ownership-and-component-records).
Parameters inherit the [origin/platform rules](../performance.md#dimensions-and-parameter-binding).
`JOIN` and `L` use the [resource algebra](../performance/derivations/resources.md#evaluation-algebra);
[neural regions](../performance/derivations/neural.md#named-region-bindings) supply the shared terms.
Implementation estimates use selected execution regions and matched local/parent
observations under [execution estimation](../performance/derivations/resources.md#execution-estimation).
References and tests describe controls; they do not assert current performance qualification.

### `MODEL:EMBEDDING`

**Contract.** Look up encoded vocabulary rows, returning the required floating activations with token order,
precision and lifetime preserved.

**Parameters.** Architecture: width `h`, vocabulary and row encoding. Workload: `m` input tokens, distinct row
identities and input/output residency.

**Composition.** `D_EMBED=EMBED(m,h,rows)` from [embedding](../performance/derivations/neural.md#embedding-and-elementwise-regions).
Union repeated rows; the vocabulary head is separate work unless joined by its parent.

**Dimensions.**

| ID | Metric and boundary | Theoretical bound |
|---|---|---|
| `MODEL:EMBEDDING/EXEC` | Elapsed seconds for `u=m` lookups through output readiness. | `L(D_EMBED)`; rate upper bound `m/L`. |

**Implementations and controls.**

#### `MODEL:EMBEDDING:MAG:RESIDENT`

- **Implementation:** Look up token rows in resident float or affine weights; the latter gathers encoded rows and
  dequantizes in a fused row-lookup kernel through MLX. Own lookup composition and
  execution dependencies, preserving
  vocabulary identity.
- **Reference / validation:** Independently loaded upstream embedding and direct indexing of independently dequantized rows.
  Check token order, repeats, dtype and values.


### `MODEL:EXPERTS`

**Contract.** Given hidden rows, selected expert IDs and their coefficients, return the weighted
sum of expert outputs. Routing chooses IDs and coefficients; execution owns projection,
activation and reduction, preserving the supplied activation and numerical contract.

**Parameters.** Architecture: hidden/expert widths `h,f_e`, encoded gate/up/down tensors and activation.
Workload: row assignments `m_e`, with `sum_e m_e=m*t`, output requirements and residency.

**Composition.** `D_EXPERTS=JOIN({MLP(m_e,h,f_e)} for m_e>0)` using
[projections/experts](../performance/derivations/neural.md#projections-and-experts). Union each selected expert’s
weights; count each required row/expert evaluation. Output geometry is `m*h`.
Per-expert hidden vectors are internal intermediates and need not be materialized.

**Dimensions.**

| ID | Metric and boundary | Theoretical bound |
|---|---|---|
| `MODEL:EXPERTS/EXEC` | Elapsed seconds for `u=m*t` selected expert evaluations, including output readiness. | `L(D_EXPERTS)`; rate upper bound `u/L`. |

**Implementations and controls.**

#### `MODEL:EXPERTS:MAG:RESIDENT_GATHERED`

- **Implementation:** Resident encoded weights execute selected experts and their weighted sum.
  Compatible short-row SwiGLU fuses gate/up/activation, writes native activations
  and consumes them in a fused down/reduction kernel;
  other geometries use MLX gathers and the supplied activation. Routing remains caller-owned.
- **Reference / validation:** Upstream expert module and a per-expert gather/matmul oracle. Match weights and activation;
  exercise assignment order, repeats, sparse/dense utilization and shapes on both sides of
  sorting selection.


### `MODEL:ATTENTION`

**Contract.** Prepared Q and logically equivalent KV histories produce scaled causal/windowed attention.
Append and state ownership are external; layouts must be matched or explicitly adapted.

**Parameters.** Architecture: `h_q,h_kv,d_k,d_v`, dtypes and numerical contract. Workload: row count `b`,
query width `q`, old lengths `l_i`, window, scale, masks and boundary residency.

**Composition.** `D_ATTN=ATTN(geometry,visibility)` from [attention](../performance/derivations/neural.md#attention). It contains
unique visible KV, Q/output and optional conventional QK/weighted-V/softmax work. Layout
adaptation belongs to the selected implementation estimate; avoid compulsory score matrices
and duplicate KV-head reads.

**Dimensions.**

| ID | Metric and boundary | Theoretical bound |
|---|---|---|
| `MODEL:ATTENTION/EXEC` | Elapsed seconds for `u=bq` queries through attended-output readiness. | `L(D_ATTN)`; rate upper bound `bq/L`. |

**Implementations and controls.**

#### `MODEL:ATTENTION:MAG:PAGED`

- **Implementation:** Prepared Q and a logical paged KV view produce scaled, causal/windowed attention output. Owned
  `MTL` kernels through MLX compute softmax partials and combine them for supported short
  queries. Small histories reduce within one kernel; intermediate histories use
  fixed token partitions. Long histories use a bounded number of partitions,
  cooperative query/head tiles and parallel partial reduction.
  All paths read the same page maps and bounded append buffers, accumulating partials in
  FP32. Other geometries delegate to `MODEL:ATTENTION:MAG:GATHERED`. Storage append is
  outside this contract.
- **Reference / validation:** The gathered implementation at identical logical histories, plus an independent
  higher-precision attention equation oracle. Compare masks, row lengths, windows, fragmented
  views and output values; the child fallback cannot independently validate itself.


#### `MODEL:ATTENTION:MAG:GATHERED`

- **Implementation:** Gather logical paged histories, pad compatible rows, construct causal/window masks and call
  `MODEL:ATTENTION:MLX:DENSE`. This is an owned adapter around an upstream primitive, not an
  upstream paged implementation.
- **Reference / validation:** Independently materialized logical K/V and per-row attention equations. Test ordering,
  heterogeneous histories, padding and window boundaries; comparing with the paged path alone
  cannot establish a shared mask convention.


#### `MODEL:ATTENTION:MLX:DENSE`

- **Implementation:** Upstream scaled dot-product attention over prepared dense Q/K/V, scale and supported mask.
  Runtime/primitive source is MLX.
- **Reference / validation:** Independent attention equations with higher-precision accumulation, declared output tolerance
  and matching causal/window visibility. Direct calls serve as a control for wrappers; they do
  not validate MLX against itself.


### `MODEL:GATED_DELTA`

**Contract.** Prepared Q/K/V, decay, beta and initial matrix state produce requested outputs and final
state; a state-only reconciliation operation preserves the same update equations.

**Parameters.** Architecture: `h_v,d_k,d_v`, state/input dtypes and update equations. Workload: `b,q`,
prepared input values, initial/final observability and output versus state-only operation.

**Composition.** `D_DELTA=DELTA(geometry,inputs,state)` from
[recurrence](../performance/derivations/neural.md#gated-delta-recurrence). Only required initial/final state crosses
the boundary; state may stay local across tokens. Projections/convolution belong to enclosing
mixers.

**Dimensions.**

| ID | Metric and boundary | Theoretical bound |
|---|---|---|
| `MODEL:GATED_DELTA/EXEC` | Elapsed seconds for `u=bq` updates through required output/state readiness. | `L(D_DELTA)` with the selected output obligation. |

**Implementations and controls.**

#### `MODEL:GATED_DELTA:MAG:FUSED_UPDATE`

- **Implementation:** Prepared Q/K/V, decay, beta and initial matrix state produce outputs and final state. An owned
  `MTL` update holds state vectors across its token loop; a state-only form supports
  accepted-prefix reconciliation. It excludes projections, convolution and input/output
  preparation.
- **Reference / validation:** `MODEL:GATED_DELTA:LM:STANDARD` and an independent explicit recurrence. Compare every
  requested output, final state and prefix states under the same prepared inputs; include
  zero/full/partial accepted prefixes.


#### `MODEL:GATED_DELTA:LM:STANDARD`

- **Implementation:** MLX-LM's gated-delta kernel under the same prepared input/output/state computation. Binding
  conventions do not change its source.
- **Reference / validation:** An independently expressed recurrence provides the oracle; the owned update supplies a
  differential control but is not itself proof of truth.
