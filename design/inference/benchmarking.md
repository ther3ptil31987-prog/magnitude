# Inference benchmarking

Measurements follow component ownership. A faster end-to-end answer does not by
itself establish faster model execution, and a faster kernel does not establish
better serving performance.

| Boundary | Measures | Appropriate control |
|---|---|---|
| Operator / storage | Completed tensor work, state movement and allocation | Same inputs and state with an independent implementation |
| Model executor | Prefill or decode from a fixed state | Upstream program at matching geometry and output demands |
| Generation | Plain or speculative advancement, acceptance and repair | Independent requests and the same target algorithm |
| Engine | Scheduling, admission, batching, retention and delivery | Matched offered traffic through our engine and an upstream generator |
| Serving | Rendering, HTTP, semantic output and sessions | Actual stock servers through the shared Python session client |

Benchmarks are one Python project under `inference/benchmarks/`: Session Bench,
fixtures, host facts and engine adapters (the native engine, llama.cpp, mlx-vlm and
omlx). Workload inputs and dependencies are explicit. A shared runner owns isolated
child lifetime, warmup, repetitions, completion, validation and immutable result
records. There is no separate TOML experiment language. [Session bench](session-bench.md) supplies canonical
BFCL-derived serving traffic and reports within the same package.

## Valid comparisons

Record artifact and runtime identity, composition, input geometry, output work,
memory policy and timing boundary. Both granular benchmarks and session bench capture
the executing host's hostname, OS version, model identifier, chip, physical CPU cores,
memory in bytes and GPU names/core counts before timed work. They use the same typed
hardware record; unavailable details are null and failed probes retain errors. Hostname
identifies the execution machine rather than inferring location from an SSH session.
The shared measurement lifecycle also records actual sensor temperatures in Celsius
before setup, periodically throughout the run, and after cleanup. Retain timestamped
per-sensor readings, probe duration, sensor grouping, time-weighted means, extrema
and coverage alongside each run; averages exclude missing readings and gaps. CPU/GPU
group labels describe sensor associations, not documented core identities. Unavailable
probes remain explicit errors rather than zero temperatures or thermal-pressure substitutes.
The trace covers the whole run, including setup and warmup, and survives managed
failure and cancellation. Sampling runs outside timed operations without GPU work;
its overhead is not subtracted from measurements. Recording does not imply a cooldown
policy or establish that a comparison is thermally matched.
Complete asynchronous work inside timing;
keep loading, reset and correctness checks outside unless the claim includes them.
Measure shared device service once. Per-request participation and public latency
are different quantities and must be labelled as such.

Execution parity requires matched rendered input and generated work. Fixed-output
controls record actual tokens and compare outputs, not just configured allowances.
Tool workloads may produce different prose, calls or reasoning despite identical
logical requests. Preserve those differences as serving evidence; do not interpret
their completion ratio as a kernel or scheduler ratio. Emission-based upstream
timings are not interchangeable with native model-service counters.

Batch size, query width and quantization can change numerical results. Retain
rejected equality checks and diagnose them against independent computation at
matching geometry. Do not relax a correctness gate to make a timing admissible.
Unsupported batching must be visible rather than silently measured as batching.

## Evidence and progress

Start with resident plain execution, separating single-session and concurrent
traffic. Qualify speculation and custom components as explicit substitutions.
Cover prompt and decode service, mixed arrivals, context lengths, membership
changes and prefix reuse. A throughput improvement that weakens an interruption
target is a policy trade-off and must be compared and reported as such.

Keep failed controls and raw observations alongside successful results. Source
snapshots and run records are historical evidence, not maintained source. Promote
useful diagnostic workloads into typed subjects and retain meaningful regression
tests; archive superseded one-off scripts outside the working source tree.
Performance ceilings and cross-engine parity remain measured claims, never
guarantees inferred from unit tests or a small number of favorable cases.
