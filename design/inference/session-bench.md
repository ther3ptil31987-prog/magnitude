# Session bench

Session bench is development tooling that measures inference serving using simulated agent sessions.
It is not an agent evaluator, the official BFCL leaderboard, or the application's ICN lifecycle.
It calls disposable serving processes directly and does not change first-party product ownership.
It is one self-contained Python project under inference/benchmarks, with its fixtures, engine
adapters and host evidence; the command is session-bench. It imports no inference engine
implementation.

## Selection and identity

Commands select models, engines, sections, context targets and optional repetitions. No experiment
files are authored or loaded. Model aliases live exclusively in inference/benchmarks/models.local.json,
gitignored and resolved relative to that file. Aliases map MLX/GGUF representations to local paths
or pinned Hub references. No home-directory alias configuration or checked-in model registry exists.
Magnitude means the native engine binary serving a GGUF; upstream llama.cpp, MLX-VLM and oMLX are
comparison engines. The old llama.cpp/ICN engine and the Python engines are not targets. Engine
source directory names are not public IDs. The native engine's binary, device, kernel cache and
generation method are explicit selections recorded in the reproduction command.

## Work and measurement

Pinned and hash-verified BFCL interactions, pinned prose, and versioned RULER-derived synthetic
retrieval recipes build deterministic requests. Tool and prose workloads construct canonical completed
history. Retrieval fixes facts and questions independently of sizing and uses complete distractor
records to resize context; evidence depth moves the fact block without changing its answers.
Retrieval checkpoints preserve requested order and repeats, and never replay probe answers into
later snapshots. Request bodies, expectations and dependencies are shared across targets. Observed output
never becomes the input to subsequent shared requests. Context targets are approximate input sizes;
terminal engine counts are authoritative measurements. Session, independent concurrency, fork,
concurrency pressure and memory sections describe offered traffic; evidence explicitly distinguishes
history sharing from actual retained-prefix reuse. No retention claim follows from session shape alone.

Prose repeat preserves paragraph boundaries in normalized source. Each request retains its system
message, supplies the passage as an assistant message, and ends with a user instruction quoting the
opening of the paragraph to copy. It deterministically chooses the latest supplied paragraph boundary
with at least the completion budget of source tokens remaining; the passage start is also eligible.
Source contribution is measured with the selected renderer as the prefixed assistant suffix count minus
prefix-only assistant framing. Insufficient source fails explicitly. No sentence or word fallback changes the
selection. Provenance records the recipe version, supplied passage bounds, selected copy start,
available source tokens and completion budget. Canonical completed history copies the selected source
suffix, independently of observed output. Context sizes can therefore select different text near the
end; this workload does not promise an identical answer across context checkpoints. Prose-repeat
qualification builds a separate short passage and final copy request with the same fixture rules.

Tool requests have a fixed 32,768 completion-token allowance, prose 256 and retrieval 1,024, with no
CLI or environment override. Engine capacity must cover rendered inputs plus that full allowance within model limits.
Shared capacity rounds up to 256-token allocation boundaries.
Preparation tokenization is capacity evidence, never measured token evidence. It uses the target's
own counting or rendering interface, never another engine's tokenizer. Length termination is
truncation for tools and retrieval, including parseable partial answers. Prose may terminate normally
at its full output budget; ending for length before that budget is truncation.
Sampling is greedy, seed 42 where supported, and model-selected thinking is disabled.

Adapters own engine preparation, launch, readiness and cleanup; shared code owns session scheduling,
HTTP/SSE, semantic validation and reporting. Preparation installs frozen dependencies and obtains
artifacts before timed work. Measurement is offline with verified source, artifact and runtime identity.
An adapter that can configure serving context must set it to the context of the launched block and
require readiness to report that exact value. Host-only fixture and prompt counting may inspect larger
rendered inputs within artifact capability without causing the numerical engine to allocate the
artifact's maximum context.
Optional watchdog bounds on time without progress (request start or finish, streamed events, engine
output) and on each request's elapsed time retire the engine and fail the run with the exceeded
bound; they are recorded in the reproduction command.
Only one benchmark owns the machine's managed benchmark process lifetime at once. Targets run
sequentially, with balanced fresh-process passes and cache-disjoint warmup. Within a target, requests
follow the declared dependency graph and release schedule. Prefix policy is recorded and verified;
the initial cross-engine baseline disables retained prefixes and does not claim cached-session results.

Terminal usage and native timing counters must agree. No native time or token count is fabricated
from text or client latency. Different artifacts/templates or observed prompt counts prevent strict
comparison. Stock MLX-VLM emission timing is labeled and excluded from cross-engine native phase
ratios. Tool calls are matched as a multiset with complete assignment across overlapping alternatives.
Retrieval answers are exact JSON string mappings with duplicate keys rejected. Report whole-answer
accuracy and partial field accuracy separately; additional keys fail whole-answer equality. Retrieval
qualification uses a separate short fixture. Synthetic fixtures retain upstream reference, local recipe,
seed, sizing identity, requested/actual lengths, record positions and content digest. Rebuilding a size
with the same fixture and renderer reproduces the same input, independently of prior preparations.
Different generated prose or tool encodings are real serving-work differences, not evidence of
slower neural execution. Use fixed-work component/engine controls from the
[benchmark hierarchy](benchmarking.md) to isolate those costs.

## Persistence and lifecycle

Each measured invocation creates inference/benchmarks/runs/session-bench/<UTC-id>/ before preparation. It saves
the public invocation and a shell-quoted reproduction command expanded to immutable engine/artifact
pairs. Reproduction does not read old result schemas or depend on aliases; local paths still require
the recorded bytes, and exact historical reproduction requires recorded code/dependencies/hardware.
Relevant source snapshots, artifact hashes, corpus identity, runtime versions and effective policy
accompany results. The shared benchmark hardware record is captured once before preparation,
retained in the initial run record and final summary, and identified in the Markdown report.
The shared benchmark temperature recorder spans preparation through engine cleanup;
its per-sensor Celsius trace and summary remain attached when serving observations
are imported into the performance store. Reports label temperature aggregates as
whole-run evidence, rather than attributing them to individual requests or targets.
Only relevant source is captured, never credentials or the full environment.

Events and completed request results are appended and flushed during execution. Final summaries and
Markdown are written atomically. Partial failures and cancellation preserve evidence and trigger
bounded process-tree retirement. Inspection does not initialize engines. Interrupted runs cannot
appear completed. Historical formats need no migration or execution support; raw evidence and
self-contained reports remain accessible.

Reports show failure/invalid/truncated counts and metric denominators. Context scaling may summarize
semantically invalid but protocol-complete results, separately from correctness. Retrieval includes
both correct and incorrect protocol-complete answers in latency summaries for every section; all
recorded retrieval requests enter accuracy denominators, with unscored failures earning zero.
Other tool sections require both gates. Protocol/transport errors, timeouts, cancellation and truncation
never enter performance summaries. Warmup and qualification are separate from measured observations.

## Acceptance

Tests demonstrate deterministic shared sessions, local alias resolution, alias-independent saved
commands, immutable output policy, input-plus-output capacity checks, fragmented SSE handling,
terminal consistency, non-greedy semantic matching, cancellation cleanup, watchdog retirement and
persistent partial results. Retrieval tests additionally demonstrate reversible resizing, stable facts, depth control,
strict answer matching, no answer leakage and failure-inclusive accuracy denominators. Prose-repeat
tests verify paragraph preservation, final instruction placement, deterministic latest-boundary
selection across context and output sizes, sufficient copy source and canonical suffix history.
Adapter integration is qualified against the actual serving interface, not an invented
benchmark-only inference implementation. Unsupported capabilities fail explicitly.
