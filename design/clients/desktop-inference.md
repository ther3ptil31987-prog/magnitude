# Desktop inference application

The existing Electron application is the local inference product. Its retained renderer owns one
SDK connection and one client-common Effect Query runtime. Electron main owns the tray and service
supervisor; ACN owns the inference engine. Renderer recreation rereads ACN and never restarts it.
The application snapshot identifies Desktop ownership with its tray state, separately from Headless
ownership. Renderer background-activity presentation reads that Desktop variant directly.
Every platform exposes full Quit in its native application menu, including when no tray host exists.
Window Close remains hide-only; menu Quit uses the same awaited owner shutdown as tray and CLI.
Unix SIGTERM requests that same awaited shutdown; it does not bypass child retirement.
macOS/Linux system-shutdown notification requests cleanup without vetoing OS termination or opening
a shutdown-error dialog. The OS may allow less time than normal Quit; native lifetime containment
remains the fallback. Windows confirmed session end can terminate Electron synchronously, so an
asynchronous event handler is not a graceful-shutdown guarantee; owned jobs must contain that exit.
Main permits three automatic renderer-crash retries. After exhaustion or a failed main-document load,
model observations become unavailable and the tray retains Open and Quit. Explicit Open retries
the renderer with a renewed budget. Background demand never renews it or shows a window. Renderer
failure cannot terminate or restart the service, and teardown never starts renderer recovery.
The privileged IPC transport identifies each preload/runtime occurrence independently of its retained
window. Crash or main-document navigation disconnects that occurrence and releases its subscriptions.
Messages carry the renderer-session identity; retired requests and queued replies cannot cross into
another occurrence. Same-document navigation preserves the current session. Only the main frame
may access the host RPC transport. Finite host calls declare replay policy; state-changing host
actions are at-most-once and lost replies are not replayed into a replacement renderer session.

The main destinations are Discover, Catalog, My Models, Connections, Usage, Status, and Settings. Service health and
model residency are distinct facts. There is no permanent bottom status strip. Usage and Connections begin directly with their content and controls beneath the page heading, without descriptive subtitles. Discover includes the connection guidance described below. Usage has one top toolbar: its model selection applies to the entire page, while its labeled Totals period controls the summary metrics. The 53-week token activity calendar remains a year view for that model. The calendar sits directly on the page without a surrounding card, background, or border; a compact current streak with an orange flame sits immediately left of the annual token total above the chart, with flat metric rows below. Week columns and weekday rows expose exact dates and recorded token counts on hover and keyboard focus, with one tab stop and arrow-key navigation. A neutral zero level and four increasing theme-blue levels scale against the busiest day. Only the current streak is shown, counting consecutive positive-token days; an unfinished today preserves a streak ending yesterday. Month labels identify the calendar without a separate date-range caption or bottom statistics. Calendar loading and failure remain distinct from zero activity. Discover, Catalog, My Models, Connections, and Usage occupy the top of the sidebar; Status and Settings stay pinned at the bottom. Discover leads with observed hardware, a Fast-to-Smart slider with five visible stops and clickable labels, and five recommendations with assessment-derived radar profiles, allowing up to two configurations per model in score order. Discover presents one shared panel with five compact numbered selection rows beside a single selected-model profile. While a recommended model is downloading or updating, Discover replaces the entire right profile pane with a centered download display, preserving the pane's width and height. It shows transferred and total bytes, a clear progress bar and percentage, current transfer speed, estimated time remaining, and cancellation. Estimates derive from observed remaining bytes and transfer rate, as in the CLI; absent or zero rates do not imply an ETA. Preparation stages stay explicit. The downloading model is selected while its transfer is active, and the ordinary profile returns after completion or cancellation. Only the selected model shows actions; Profile and Details controls switch the right pane without adding a full-width disclosure footer. A recommendation whose last load failed carries a small amber marker on its row; hovering it explains the failure, including the memory breakdown for low memory, while the profile pane keeps its Load action and shows no inline load notice above the radar. The best match is selected initially and when the ranking preference changes. Preference changes update the existing panel without replaying an entrance fade or blanking the list and profile; radar geometry transitions between values, with motion disabled for reduced-motion preferences. Selection is local presentation state and never loads a model. If a selected recommendation disappears, the first available recommendation supplies the profile. Radar charts place each metric value beside its axis label, without a separate values list. Charts and their loading placeholders have a bounded size, shrink to fit narrow panes, and remain horizontally centered; wider panes add surrounding space instead of increasing chart height. Discover contains no catalog search or full catalog list. The separate Catalog destination owns the full collection, search, compatibility filtering, and expandable details with radar charts. My Models shows only acquisition/library entries, never the undownloaded catalog. Best-effort and deprecated models carry a visible support label with the reason on hover. A deprecated model appears only when installed; it has no load, update, or download action, names its replacement, and offers one switch action that downloads the replacement or, once downloaded, loads it, beside ordinary removal. Catalog and My Models each have one page heading with a small matching model count pinned to the right of the same row, without a redundant subtitle or section heading. A compact controls row combines dropdown filters and sorting on the left with search on the right, wrapping at narrow widths. Catalog filters by machine fit and defaults to recommendation order; both pages offer name and download-size sorting. My Models defaults to name order and filters by downloaded or downloading (including updates) state. Search and filters compose, and an empty filtered result is distinct from an empty library. Loading placeholders preserve the header and controls geometry. Connections show the supported harnesses’ own artwork in a single column at every window width; loading placeholders use the same layout. Discovery uses the
curated ACN catalog, hardware observations, and the shared ranking algorithm; no renderer-owned
catalog, hardware inference, or independent recommendation source exists.
Settings reads the running application's version from the privileged host independently of service
readiness; it never substitutes a hardcoded version or the service protocol version.
Main owns scheduled Magnitude-hosted update checks, automatic downloads and explicit Settings actions
independently of the renderer and service readiness. The automatic-download preference does not
disable checks. Window Close and observer loss cannot cancel admitted work. Magnitude-owned user data
lives under the shared `.magnitude` root: canonical config owns appearance and the automatic-download preference,
root identity.pem owns request identity, electron/ owns Electron userData and sessionData configured
before profile initialization, state/ owns application coordination, and updates/ owns one installer
and one update.json. Isolated development/test roots preserve the same layout.

A complete verified download publishes the exact public release and an installation union:
Unattempted, Attempted, or Failed with a bounded reason. No persisted state claims readiness,
installer liveness or success. Ordinary Quit cancels incomplete downloads and retains prepared
updates. macOS does not stage Squirrel until installation is requested. The local staging endpoint
exposes only that archive and closes on success, failure, or interruption.

Before ACN starts, startup reconciles native exclusion and the installed version. Reaching or passing
the saved release retires both files regardless of the saved outcome. Only Unattempted may install
automatically; a background Linux launch defers interactive authorization without marking an attempt.
Startup and explicit restart/retry use the same offline signature/size/hash verification and durable
Attempted write before native invocation. Explicit restart first retires owned children while retaining
application ownership. A failed attempt retains bytes and its actual reason; an unresolved Attempted
record displays “The update did not complete” and requires explicit retry. Retry never redownloads
valid retained bytes. Desktop settings and `magnitude update discard` can remove a retained download
under the same owner admission; failed cleanup preserves the previous presentation so it can be
retried. Discard does not change update preferences. Missing or invalid evidence cannot authorize installation.

Platform helpers hold a native installation lease across owner exit, installer execution and
same-release outcome recording, releasing it before relaunch. Competing bootstrap exits without
waiting while holding application ownership. An older Mac app defers while its native installer is
active; an installed target or newer version may reconcile successfully during native relaunch.
Unknown native state cannot grant old-app startup. Foreground intent belongs to the live handoff,
not another persisted update field. The Mac helper captures native job identity before staging,
waits for Squirrel to finish replacement, and launches the app with the retiring environment and
explicit window intent. Native automatic relaunch must not discard an isolated profile or show a
window after background startup. Cleanup is recoverable and cannot race an active installer.
Development profiles disable native update actions unless explicitly built for isolated acceptance.
Linux retains the signed package for an explicit handoff to the system package manager. The user
helper acknowledges readiness before owner exit, then waits on the inherited lifetime channel.
An explicit update action may request authorization even while the window is hidden; background
startup defers that prompt. Relaunch window intent is independent of authorization permission.
Polkit authorizes only the privileged package operation. That operation verifies installed,
root-owned publisher trust, target/version, copied package bytes and native package identity before
invoking the package manager. Existing installation admission excludes another running app owner;
an authorization or package-manager failure never means success. The helper relaunches as the
original user, preserving whether the window was open, and records a retryable failure when needed.
It is transient installation work, not an independent service owner or a login service.
The packaged Linux desktop adopts the launcher's shared installation descriptor before starting
children and marks it close-on-exec. The desktop retains package admission until process exit;
service and update-helper children cannot inherit the lease and block their own installation.
Recommendations order fitting assessed configurations using the shared preference. The remaining
curated catalog stays discoverable with explicit pending, assessment-failed, or insufficient-memory
explanations; every fitting model has a speed estimate. Details
expose catalog license/source links, capabilities, context, and the estimated speed as one range
(the radar's) with a dim note that it is a rough estimate and does not account for speculative
decoding. Speed is a plain-decode estimate from memory bandwidth, accurate to roughly ±20% for most
models, and is never shown as a per-context table of exact rates.
Source links open HTTPS destinations in the system browser. Loading a different model asks
explicitly before replacing observed active residency.

The desktop session service owns navigation and bridges native menu actions into the same model
mutations used by the window. Window and tray model commands pass through the shared local-model
service; hooks expose actions and command status without exposing mutation atoms to the renderer.
Tray model text is a disposable projection of the canonical model
query. Loss of renderer observation disables model actions; it cannot imply no model is loaded.
An active model's tray line is `<model> · <phase>` with, on the right, a spinner for work without a
measure of its own, the percentage and a filling ring while tuning or importing weights, or the
memory a loaded model holds. Phases are single words from a fixed set (Waiting, Preparing,
Optimizing, Loading, Finalizing, Loaded, Stopping). On macOS the line is a native view on the menu
item, drawn by the desktop's own tray addon (built with the desktop and shipped in its resources,
separate from the desktop host addon), so it updates while the menu is open; main pops the menu up
itself because Electron keeps running JavaScript only during a menu it pops up. Like a plain menu
item the line fits the full model name, never truncating it: it holds room for the widest phase
and detail so that only a model change alters its width, and an open menu never narrows. Other
platforms show the same line as the item's plain label, current each time the menu opens.
Main independently displays owned-service startup, recovery, failure, and shutdown.
Stop remains available for an observed Stopping model, allowing explicit escalation or retry after
cleanup failure. Window actions suppress duplicate requests while their mutation is pending and
present compact, wrapping notices below the affected controls. Notices use the canonical error,
warning, or information palette, an icon and concise title; optional actions are plain text with
hover underline, keyboard focus and pending/eligibility guards. Actions invoke existing feature
operations; observing or expanding a notice never retries work. Essential text is never truncated.
User-facing content is authored from typed facts: diagnostics, raw byte counts, internal IDs and
backend prose never appear in notices, tooltips, expanded details, or native dialogs. Unknown
failures use truthful operation-specific wording; original diagnostics remain available to logging.
Memory admission explains the additional memory needed and offers a human-readable breakdown using
the shared memory units, rounding minimum requirements upward. Storage uses the shared disk units.
A matching model-command rejection is represented once by its richer authoritative failure;
unrelated commands and transport failures remain separate. Retry supersedes only the same command's
feedback; authoritative readiness also retires obsolete load feedback. Stop rejection has one page-level placement. Failed reads replace loading placeholders
without implying an empty, stopped, disconnected or zero state. Settings save failures take precedence
over older warnings, and persistent restart guidance remains derived from saved-versus-active state.
Native dialogs retain their existing native controls and cleanup decisions with safe explanations. ACN resolves both active and slot Stop against Stopping as well as Loading
and Ready instances, so retry never silently succeeds without contacting the retained instance.
Main retains the current tray menu independently of its native icon. Linux host recovery replaces
the preceding icon before creating one replacement and restores the latest menu. Host loss never
stops serving, destroys the window, or requests activation. Menu updates and replacement are serialized;
application shutdown terminalizes tray ownership so late observations cannot recreate an icon.
Status and application control expose tray registration separately from service/model state. Registered
means native registration was requested successfully, not guaranteed pixel visibility or user pinning.
The tray shows service and model state without a setup-completion state. First use follows the ordinary Discover, model and connection actions.

A background launch starts the owner and tray without showing or focusing a window. Explicit Show
Window or navigation intent opens it. On Windows, left-click or double-click on the tray icon opens
the window; right-click opens its context menu. Dock activation reopens a hidden window and explicit Open
restores a minimized window. Raising or reactivating the retained window preserves its selected page;
only an explicit destination from a native menu action requests navigation. Window close hides the retained renderer. Full Quit stops owned
children, proves cleanup, and releases application ownership. Cleanup failure stays visible
and retains ownership. The failure dialog offers Keep Open, Retry Quit, and an explicit Force Quit
that warns cleanup is unproven and exits unsuccessfully. Cancel never forces exit. Application control carries lifecycle intent and observation,
not another model API.
Fatal application initialization failure releases acquired resources, reports the original failure,
and exits unsuccessfully. Background failure cannot leave an inert process running without control;
foreground startup also presents the failure. Service-supervisor failures remain recoverable in
the running tray and window and do not use this fatal initialization path.

Connections observe actual provider configuration, required skills, and plugin integrity through the
privileged host. Detected installations appear first, with installation and Magnitude connection status shown separately. Within installed harnesses, connected entries appear first with a green dot and their configuration paths; disconnected entries use a neutral dot and do not present expected paths as existing configuration. Unverifiable configuration remains an explicit unknown state. Undetected harnesses appear below with their artwork, Not installed status, and an official installation link; configuration details and connection actions are hidden until installation is detected. Detection refreshes automatically and has no manual Detect action. Saved connection receipts govern restoration and ownership, not the Connected label.
Filesystem access failures remain distinguishable from missing or overwritten configuration. Connect
writes configuration and required artifacts without launching a harness. Login startup is a separate
explicit preference. Headless commands and the desktop share one connector implementation.
Harness environment discovery is bounded asynchronous work, independent of tray and service startup.
It never mutates the application environment. Connections use the resolved search path, configuration
roots, and child-command environment; explicit command overrides remain authoritative. Failure falls
back to the inherited environment. Quit cancels the probe and retires its child process group.
Connect preserves the harness's
current model. For an installed harness, Connect repairs configuration that has been overwritten; Disconnect removes an intact managed connection. Connection status sits beneath the harness title, with connection actions in the header. Only connected cards have a divided configuration-details section.
Connected cards show a compact inline downloaded, compatible model selector and the exact
agent command on the same row, with the model on the left and command on the right. The entire
command box copies the full command; overflow truncates visually. Hover highlights its border and
background, and copied confirmation resets after three seconds. Configuration paths sit in a collapsed disclosure on the left of a single footer row, with terminal guidance aligned right. Each card owns its presentation selection; it defaults
to an available active model, then the best-ranked downloaded model. Removing an option falls back
to an available model. Selecting or copying never connects, loads a model, launches a terminal, or
writes harness defaults. Commands select the provider and model for that invocation. macOS/Linux
commands use POSIX shell quoting; Windows instructions explicitly target PowerShell. OpenClaw has
separate terminal and in-TUI model commands because its TUI has no model launch flag. Empty model
lists offer download guidance instead of an invalid command. Refresh and Disconnect remain secondary.
Intact configuration without a receipt can be Connected but is not claimed as removable owned state.
Connections remain observable while the inference service is unavailable: configuration integrity
does not depend on whether a model or service is running. Status combines service readiness, model residency, and active downloads in one top section while keeping their states distinct. Idle downloads add no empty section. An unavailable model observation never means that no model is loaded; service failure
also suppresses stale model controls. Model stopping uses the same canonical mutation as the tray
and model library.
Status displays observed model-loading progress and current download, update, and removal activity.
Unknown progress stays indeterminate; service or query unavailability cannot become an idle claim.
While a model loads, its residency text names the stage in full (for example "Optimizing for
<accelerator>…", "Loading weights…") and the bar below shows the load's measured fraction with its
percentage to the bar's right; a requested load is preparing at zero, so nothing snaps back when it
starts. A loaded model's residency text includes the memory it holds.
A model's download card stays in place and becomes its optimization: "Preparing to optimize…"
while preparing, then "Optimizing for <accelerator>…" (or "Optimizing…" when the previewed device
is unknown) while tuning. The finished download's full bar pulses while preparing and then gives
way to the tuning fraction without jumping backwards; the card describes the work as one-time setup
for this device with its percentage and an estimated time remaining from the observed tuning rate,
and its cancel action reads "Skip optimization". While the card is shown, load and remove are not
offered beside it; skipping restores them, and an inference request still loads the model, which
ends the optimization. Download selection, the Downloading filter and activity include optimizing
models, whose activity label is `<model> · Optimizing`.

Connection observations refresh after mutations and periodically while observed, so edits made by
other tools become visible. Unrelated user fields do not invalidate a connection. Development profiles
isolate harness configuration and skills from the user's normal profile.

## Visual identity

Discover offers “Connect Agent” for a downloaded recommendation in place of model load/stop
controls, without a remove-download button. It navigates to Connections without loading a model. Download completion exposes this
action through the observed acquisition state. Catalog and My Models retain load/stop controls.
Discover has no separate connection link or hint.

The inference rewrite preserves the existing desktop/web visual identity. Reuse the existing
appearance initializer, with System, Light, and Dark choices. Desktop appearance is owned by the
client host and persisted as `appearance` in its canonical config. Absence means System. Main reads
it before window creation; the renderer reads it through the host bridge before its first render.
Successful saves update native and renderer appearance; failed saves retain the previous appearance
and surface an error. Desktop preference writes are serialized so appearance and update choices do
not overwrite each other. Appearance reads never rewrite malformed configuration; existing general config recovery may
preserve a corrupt backup and restore defaults. A failed startup appearance read uses
System and reports the unavailable preference. Browser storage is not a desktop settings authority,
and no old browser preference is imported. Renderer reloads reread the host preference independently
of ACN readiness. The browser client retains its own persistence adapter around shared appearance
rendering.

Settings is a flat list of rows in two groups, General and About, each row a label with its
control on the right and a one-line hint only when the state needs explaining: Theme (segmented
control), Launch at login (switch), Model storage, and Automatic updates (switch), then one About row
with the application version, update status, and the single update action for the current state.
The version comes from the packaged bundle, or from the generated Magnitude version when unpackaged.

Model storage is persisted as `modelsDirectory` in the canonical `config.json` that the service reads
when it spawns the engine. The row shows the current path, marks the default, offers a native folder
chooser and a return to the default, rejects relative paths, and re-reads the file whenever Settings
opens so hand edits appear. Main records the folder in effect at launch; while the saved folder
differs, a persistent toast in the window's bottom-right corner on every page states that a restart
is required, offers Restart Magnitude, which relaunches the application through the ordinary quit
path, and shows a copyable platform-specific command that moves the previous store into the new
folder. Magnitude never moves model files itself.

When the renderer is served by the `electron-vite` dev server, Electron cannot relaunch itself:
that server belongs to the parent process and exits with the application, so a self-relaunch would
open an empty window. A development relaunch instead exits with a dedicated exit code that carries
window visibility, and the desktop dev script supervises `electron-vite dev`, starting it again with
a fresh renderer server whenever it sees that code. Any other exit ends the dev script with the
same code.

Network access is a General row with a switch, off by default, persisted as `network` in the same
`config.json` that the service reads when it binds. Turning it on generates an API key once and
reveals nested rows: Address (all interfaces or one detected IPv4 address, physical networks first,
then Tailscale, then virtual adapters), API key (the key with the copy control, Regenerate, and a
Require key switch that is on by default), and Reachable at (one OpenAI-compatible base URL for the
chosen address, or the first physical address when all interfaces are selected). Main records the
resolved settings in effect at launch; when the saved settings resolve differently the same restart
toast appears, naming network settings. Its hint links the remote server guide.
Below the harnesses, Connections presents one card for other apps and agents. It states that an
OpenAI-compatible API runs on this computer that any app or agent can use. The base URL has a copy
control, captioned that any API key works, with a note for the Anthropic path beneath it. An Example
request toggle pinned right on the note's row, wrapping beneath it in narrow windows, reveals a request for the active or best downloaded model in the
user's shell. A divided footer links to Settings for network
access. Network addresses and controls stay in Settings.
The initializer installs the canonical client-common palette variables; importing Tailwind alone
does not initialize that palette. Native window appearance follows the same selected preference. macOS integrates native traffic
lights beside the collapse toggle in the sidebar’s top row, with branding below and no separate title bar. The sidebar border and main content extend to the window’s top edge. Collapsing slides the sidebar fully away while retaining the native controls and a background-free expand toggle. Content keeps the same width in both states and is centered in the remaining area; closing the sidebar adds margins instead of reflowing content. Reduced-motion settings disable the transition, and hidden navigation is inert. The toggle is pinned to the sidebar’s right edge when expanded and uses the same sidebar icon in both states. Windows integrates native caption controls
in the application surface, with its menu accessible through Alt. Linux retains desktop-native
window decorations. Integrated controls have reserved space and a draggable top region spanning
both the sidebar and main content, including when the sidebar is collapsed; interactive
content never overlaps window controls or becomes part of the drag region.

Use the existing slate surfaces and blue actions/selections, Inter UI text, Martian Mono headings,
shared Magnitude mark, Phosphor icons exclusively, and shared button/input/progress primitives.
The Magnitude mark is a transparent white outline in dark appearance and its black inverse in
light appearance. Tray artwork uses the transparent outline; macOS template rendering follows the
menu-bar appearance. Windows tray artwork is black on a light taskbar and white on a dark taskbar,
following system theme changes independently of the application's appearance preference.
Windows uses separate multi-resolution icons rendered from the vector artwork for native display scaling.
Model identities use the landing site's family/provider artwork throughout
Discover, My Models, active-model status and download activity. Action and navigation icons retain
their existing semantics. Missing provider artwork must not be replaced with another company's logo.
Do not create a separate palette, substitute fonts, or copy a second appearance store. Desktop
sources must be included in Tailwind scanning. Both light and dark treatments require live visual
acceptance, including disabled controls, focus, progress, failures, and native window chrome.
Discover keeps its hardware and preference controls separate from model assessment. Only its combined
recommendation list and profile panel uses an assessment skeleton, with the live settled/total count
inside the panel and a determinate theme-blue progress bar when a nonzero total is known. Before assessment, the panel distinguishes waiting for hardware from loading the catalog. The hardware skeleton has an inline status in its text column distinguishing machine identification from reading chip, graphics, and memory capabilities. Recommendation status replaces the pending profile graphic, without a floating card or overlay. Indeterminate stages use a reduced-motion-aware Phosphor spinner, never a fabricated percentage or timed sequence. Partial rankings are withheld until all assessments settle; the completed panel
fades in without an external status row shifting its position. Hardware discovery uses photo, name, and specification placeholders matching the
shared hardware card layout while unobserved. Loading geometry follows the natural loaded layout, including the responsive radar aspect ratio. Never impose fixed heights, added spacing, or internal scrolling on loaded content to make it match a skeleton. Unknown hardware specifications and model details can affect final height; skeletons must not claim exact geometry for unobserved content. Reduced-motion preferences disable the fade.
Every destination retains its page shell during initial loading. Other pending observations use skeletons
with the same card geometry and responsive breakpoints as their content; independent sections settle
independently. Available content stays visible during refresh, and failures replace skeletons with
explicit unavailable states. Placeholder values never imply zero usage, no models, or a disconnected
harness. Loading regions announce once, expose no actions, and respect reduced motion. Unknown
collection lengths and installation states remain unknown until observed.

## Login startup

Settings observes OS registration rather than a saved boolean. Failed host actions preserve their
actionable message across the preload boundary without displaying internal Effect stacks. macOS registers the main application
through SMAppService and detects login launch before deciding window visibility. On first startup
of a production copy in Applications, the owner records an automatic-registration attempt before
registering a previously unseen (`not-found`) main app. Existing OS registration states are preserved.
The attempt marker survives upgrades and later opt-outs; it stores no preference. Development,
isolated profiles, and copies outside Applications never register automatically. Registration failure
is nonfatal and logged; Settings permits explicit retry. Reads never register. Successful enablement
requires OS confirmation or an explicit approval-required state. Windows registers
the installed executable with `--background` and observes startup approval for its stable application
identity. Command matching and approval must refer to that same per-user entry; a different entry
for the executable cannot substitute for it. Executable paths containing spaces remain intact. Linux uses one user XDG
autostart entry, honors desktop exclusions and disablement, and writes a Hidden override when disabled
so a lower-priority system entry cannot re-enable startup. No login adapter requests automatic OS
restart after Quit. Native platform acceptance includes signed macOS login and Windows startup approval;
filesystem simulation does not establish those guarantees.

Status presents a quiet service header with a green Ready badge and circular check on the right, above a divided model row. Model identity has a proportional logo and smaller residency text on the same line, separated by a dot; long names truncate. Stop aligns to the right. The idle state uses subdued text explaining that a model loads automatically when chatting starts; it does not imply that manual loading is required. Hardware recommendation artwork belongs to Discover, not Status. A registered tray adds nothing to Status. An unavailable tray shows one warning that closing the window keeps Magnitude running and the applications menu reopens it; native tray registration terminology stays out of the UI. Status does not show the service endpoint; connection details belong to Connections. Development/test login-startup restrictions explicitly identify the build as such.

Status presents a single Memory section using authoritative active-model residency. The headline is the sum of model weights, KV cache, and overhead across the allocation's memory domains; overhead consists of compute and auxiliary allocations. No loaded model means zero in all three categories and the headline. Loading or unavailable residency is shown explicitly, never as an estimated allocation. OS process footprint and whole-machine usage are not part of this display. The section has no measurement disclosure or explanatory footer.

Discover supplements inference hardware with a read-only native description of the client device. Enclosure identity selects bundled manufacturer product photographs through explicit manufacturer and model/family/version matches, with processor SKU guards where vendors reuse product names; it never supplies ranking, memory capacity, or processor capabilities. Unknown or placeholder identity cannot imply a known enclosure. A graphics-card image represents its hardware family and cannot identify a laptop GPU or complete PC. Product shots show one clearly visible device on an empty background, never a color lineup or multiple-angle composite, with no visible credits, license labels or reference captions. Source provenance remains in the asset inventory. Photographs remain available offline and do not assert an unobserved finish or internal configuration. Shared enclosures reuse the same image across processor variants. Firmware enclosure type classifies otherwise unknown portable, desktop, all-in-one, mini-PC, and server systems without inventing a product photo. Portable and all-in-one devices never fall back to a desktop graphics-card photograph, even with an external GPU. Component fallback requires an observed dedicated memory domain.

Hardware photos fit their cataloged nontransparent bounds into a common 4:3 frame with a 6% inset; embedded transparent margins do not determine product scale. The photo gallery shares this renderer. The hardware card groups information under CPU (or Chip for Apple Silicon/GB10), Memory, and separately labeled GPUs. A shared accelerator with the same identity as its integrated chip does not repeat the chip name; its known core counts stay with the chip. Multiple distinct accelerator entries are numbered. The hardware card distinguishes observed system RAM, unified memory, and each dedicated memory domain’s VRAM. Shared memory is never added to system RAM a second time; duplicate backend views of a domain do not repeat its capacity. The card shows one CPU cores value: observed physical cores take precedence over an exact fixed catalog fallback. Threads, duplicate specification counts, ambiguous core options, and server per-processor fallback counts are omitted from the card. Scheduling-available CPU threads remain separate internal metadata. ICN caches its native topology query once per process. No accelerator observation means CPU inference, not proof that no physical GPU exists. A small bundled catalog supplies published specifications only for exact chip or device matches; visible labels omit the internal `(spec)` suffix and do not add a tooltip; ambiguous bins omit their core counts/bandwidth; a published Apple bin can be resolved only when an observed physical core count uniquely selects it, never from process parallelism. GPU cards omit CUDA-core, compute-unit, Xe-core and stream-processor counts; these remain catalog research data. Dedicated GPU bandwidth variants use only physical device memory totals within 1% of exactly one catalog capacity, never shared memory or allocation budgets. Mobile bandwidth is a nominal maximum. Published specifications never override observed capacities, change scheduling/ranking, initiate benchmarks, or require runtime network access.

The Usage destination exposes persistent [local serving usage](../acn/local-serving-usage.md): input, cached input and output tokens, Today/All time, model filtering, measured generation speed and first-token latency. Below Memory, Status adds one compact overview row of today's tokens and requests, connected agents, and network access, each opening Usage, Connections, or Settings. Full usage statistics belong to Usage. Incomplete or unavailable evidence is explicit. Usage recording belongs to the service and continues while the window is closed.
