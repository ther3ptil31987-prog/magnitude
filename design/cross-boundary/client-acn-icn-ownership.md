# Client, ACN, and ICN ownership

## Boundary

```text
first-party clients -> one Effect Query client -> ACN RPC -> private ICN management
external inference clients --------------------> ACN /inference/** -> serving or fixed upstream
```

ACN is the complete first-party application boundary. Clients do not call ICN management routes,
consume ICN resource events, or reconstruct ACN product state from native resources. The only
public inference boundary exposes the generic local OpenAI-compatible data plane under
`/inference/v1/**`, the generic local Anthropic data plane under `/inference/anthropic/**`, and
harness-specific multiplexing proxies under `/inference/v1/proxies/codex/**` and
`/inference/anthropic/proxies/claude-code/**`.
`/inference/api/**` is not public.

## ICN responsibility

ICN is the TypeScript-side name of the inference service, `magnitude-inference`. The service hosts
the inference engine: it owns the product-facing inference API, model inventory, assessment
publication, residency and instance supervision, and runs every loaded model in a contained engine
worker process. The engine owns model interpretation, execution, memory accounting and serving
semantics inside that worker; Seismic, below the engine, is the only device and byte authority.

ICN owns physical inference truth: native models and packages, installation and download
occurrences, hardware observations, planning, assessment, safety, instance lifecycle, residency
policy, and inference execution. ICN operations revalidate native preconditions at admission.

ICN does not own Magnitude Slots, favorites, ranking preference, provider policy, presentation
states, or client interaction flows. Native changes may originate from ACN commands, chat
completions, fixed residency lifecycle, recovery, or another internal caller, so ACN observes them
independently of command attribution.

## ACN responsibility

ACN owns the complete client-facing model contract:

- `ModelCatalog`: the unified local and remote product view. A catalog local row carries one
  `acquisitionState` union covering managed installation, update, post-installation optimization,
  transfer failure, removal, and residency. A discovered local row instead carries observed discovery truth and no managed
  acquisition lifecycle. Every variant is a reachable product state; progress and failure payloads
  exist only under the states they belong to, and native occurrence identities never appear;
- `ModelSlots`: durable selection resolved to truthful client-ready Slot states;
- `LocalInferenceEnvironment`: normalized hardware and memory presentation facts; and
- model-management commands and their application-level validation. Commands are addressed by
  product identity (`modelId`, `slotId`); ACN resolves the native occurrence.

ACN also owns stable ranking scores, warnings, provider status, favorites, Slot reference
integrity, and the atomic configuration admitted to agent work. It may project ICN facts into
application semantics, but it does not become the authority for the native resource.

The public resources remain separate because they have different identities and failure causes.
They are not combined into one result or one stored God object. A screen may compose their query
results for presentation without creating another authority.

### State shape

Queries return their domain value directly. There is no public `{ revision, state }` envelope, no
generic mirrored-state abstraction, and no client-visible source revision.

A service retains authoritative state only when it owns a real domain lifecycle that cannot be
derived from a current authoritative read. Such state has a domain-specific representation and
invariants. Views fully determined by current inputs are computed directly when cheap or retained
as disposable materialized projections when shared or expensive. A retained projection is never a
parallel authority: it coalesces semantic invalidations, rebuilds from current authorities, and
serves its current value without doing reconciliation in the read path:

- hardware queries and per-model residency project current ICN observations directly;
- the unified Catalog is a pure union of the current remote catalog and local product projection,
  regardless of whether that derived projection is materialized for efficient observation;
- Slots retain their real resolved lifecycle because ACN owns durable selection, reference
  reconciliation, and admitted agent configuration together; and
- model acquisition observes ICN's model-addressed catalog-installation occurrences. ACN retains
  only its finite in-flight removal presentation because that application transition is not
  otherwise observable while the removal call runs; the client-facing Catalog remains a derived
  projection rather than retained model authority; and
- onboarding reads durable storage directly.

Subscription references are an implementation primitive, not an architecture or wire contract.

### Native observation

ACN consumes ICN's private resource observation once. A native event is notification to reread
authority; it is never installed as state. A chat-triggered automatic load follows the same path
as an explicit load command:

```text
ICN transition -> native invalidation -> authoritative ICN read -> ACN projection change
               -> ACN query-name poke -> client query invalidation and reread
```

An ICN discovery snapshot explicitly marked as incomplete reconciliation is provisional.
Provisional emptiness cannot become stable ACN product truth, but it does not delay service health.
The automatic assessment snapshot is separately observed; catalog and discovery assessment slices
remain pending or assessing until their current exact targets settle.

The inference response stream and resource observation have independent lifetimes. Cancelling a
chat request does not corrupt ACN observation, and an observation failure does not terminate or
reinterpret the response proxy.

Model assessment is not an ACN-driven finite operation. ICN owns the automatic work and exposes a
read-only snapshot plus invalidations; observing or dropping that snapshot never starts, stops, or
waits for assessment.

## Client and SDK responsibility

The SDK owns typed transport and daemon lifecycle. Client-common owns one connection-scoped Effect
Query client over ACN, shared hooks, invocation state, identity-preserving selectors, and shared
formatting. Individual clients own wording, layout, icons, and ephemeral interaction state.

Every first-party model interaction is a member of the ACN `Models` Query/Mutation group. There is
no raw RPC client, native inference management client, parallel event drain, or second model cache
in CLI, web, or client-common.

Clients render each query Result independently. Waiting or failure is not authoritative emptiness.
A failed Catalog observation cannot clear Slots; a failed Instance observation cannot erase a
durable selection; and no model-domain Result can select the daemon-disconnection screen.

Clients do not fabricate descriptors from IDs, synthesize zero-valued context, or join partial
facts into backend policy. `Unassigned` has exactly the established “No model configured”
presentation. `Resolving` is explicit and never displayed as a raw-ID fallback.

## Mutation causality

An ACN mutation acknowledges after ICN has admitted or completed the requested native action. ACN
command effects do not detach admission or removal into fire-and-forget fibers.
`CatalogInstallationOperationId` is the private causal identity for admitted catalog work;
`ModelInstanceId` identifies runtime work. Progress remains a query concern, and neither identity
crosses the ACN client boundary.

Once ACN publishes sync or removal intent, caller interruption cannot cancel the finite native
admission/removal step and strand that intent. Before intent admission, the command remains
interruptible.

The client mutation synchronizes affected queries before reporting success. For model mutations,
that means one awaited refetch of the ACN snapshot the owner has already committed; it is not a
poll or a predicate-based proof protocol. ACN change pokes remain necessary for changes caused
externally or by continuing native work. These paths are complementary:

- mutation synchronization closes the initiating client's causal window;
- change pokes converge every client and every non-command transition.

Primary Slot assignment and agent work admission share one serialization scope. This orders the
owner commit against work capture; it does not make the client authoritative.

## Failure containment

ICN failure, restart, malformed native evidence, projection failure, model absence, assessment
failure, stopped instances, and command rejection are model-domain outcomes. They cannot close the
ACN serving scope or be classified as daemon disconnection. Only confirmed loss of ACN transport
may select the daemon-disconnection presentation.

Retained state is not cleared by transient or incomplete evidence. Slot intent may be cleared only
by explicit user action or complete authoritative proof that the referenced identity is invalid.
Likewise, failure or stalled cleanup of one session runtime is confined to that exact session
generation and cannot restart ACN or interrupt ICN-owned transfers.

## Conformance

- No first-party code accesses `/inference/api/**`, native ICN management operations, or ICN
  events.
- Every ICN stream is generated from OpenAPI metadata; ACN contains no handwritten streaming
  transport. Automatic model assessment is observed as a snapshot, not a finite stream.
- Generic `/inference/v1/**` and `/inference/anthropic/**` traffic remains a transparent local ICN
  proxy. Harness-only alias discovery and upstream multiplexing exist only below the explicit
  Codex and Claude Code proxy subroutes.
- Codex WebSocket model routing and socket replacement belong to ACN; native local Responses
  WebSocket events and connection-scoped replay belong to ICN.
- Every client-visible model query and mutation belongs to the ACN `Models` group.
- Query successes are direct domain values with no generic revision envelope.
- No generic mirrored-resource service or wire schema exists. Private derived projections may
  share only the mechanical coalescing and publication primitive; their inputs, derivation, and
  lifecycle remain explicit in the owning domain service.
- Derived Catalog, Instance, and Environment views are not stored as parallel authorities.
- Model mutation synchronization awaits one fresh committed ACN snapshot; it does not poll or
  reread for proof.
- Model sync, cancellation, failure acknowledgement, and removal are addressed by canonical
  model ID. ICN exposes model-addressed catalog installation and removal plus
  `CatalogInstallationOperationId`-addressed occurrence control; raw download and Package
  identities remain private inside ICN. The authoritative native observation subsequently updates
  ACN product state.
- Incomplete ICN startup snapshots are retried to completion and cannot permanently erase installed
  or update state.
- Automatic chat loading, explicit loading, stopping, switching, installation, cancellation,
  recovery, and multi-client observation converge through the same ACN resources.
- Model-domain failures leave the same ACN process serving and never render daemon disconnection.
