# Desktop-owned service supervision

Desktop and the foreground serving host are the two application owner forms. Only their privileged
composition roots launch ACN while retaining application ownership; ACN privately owns ICN and
workers. Ordinary clients never independently download, adopt, elect, replace, or retain an ACN
process. Login startup belongs exclusively to Desktop.
The web development host uses the same application launcher with an isolated development profile
and proxies that profile's service endpoint. Closing the web host or cancelling its startup response
does not quit an already admitted desktop owner.

A kernel-held application lock excludes concurrent owners without killing a stalled predecessor.
A losing Desktop launch forwards background Ensure or explicit Open intent to another Desktop over
per-user local IPC. A Headless incumbent receives cooperative Yield; the Desktop must then acquire
the native lock before proceeding. A losing Headless launch fails without replacing the incumbent.
Unavailable or stalled owners remain bounded failures. Background demand never shows or focuses a window.
The SDK remains portable and receives a starter capability rather than OS process authority.

Application bootstrap selects one installed resource directory or one development checkout and
constructs the service command from that selection. Profile selection, native adapter location,
previous-installation retirement and per-attempt port preflight are shared host composition in
daemon-management. Installed service and adapter paths always come from the same resource directory.
Bundled CLI resource selection resolves the executing payload through filesystem symlinks and
requires the installed layout; it never substitutes a different installation found through PATH.
Development runtime and engine overrides remain explicit. Selection itself never creates state,
acquires ownership, or spawns a child; the retained owner admits supervised startup.
Foreground startup completes previous-installation retirement and one port preflight before starting
supervision, so admission errors return immediately to the command. Desktop keeps admission errors
inside supervision for its existing failure presentation. Both retain port preflight on every child
attempt, and the child's actual bind remains authoritative against races.

## Child supervision

The parent retains the raw child handle from creation, then validates exact process identity before
sending Start over its inherited control channel. The child installs native parent-loss protection
before application initialization and keeps it after Ready. Child health derives from the existing
ACN lifecycle. Readiness requires matching instance and RPC identity, not merely a PID or HTTP 200.

The parent owns bounded crash recovery. Every attempt first retires the predecessor's known process
tree. Unproven cleanup, PID reuse, an occupied endpoint, or observational failure permits neither
adoption nor a replacement. Diagnostic output is bounded and independent of control framing.

Shutdown is single-flight: reject new demand, cancel retries, request child Shutdown, wait, escalate
against the exact owned group/job, and prove absence. Root exit alone does not prove descendant
exit. The application releases its lock and tray only after shutdown, or an explicit force-quit
that truthfully reports unproven cleanup. Requester cancellation cannot abandon teardown.

Unix lifetime guards remain independent of JavaScript; separately grouped children require their
own protection. Windows uses job containment assigned at process creation. Native platform testing
is required in addition to unit tests.

## Compatibility and installation

Exact SDK RPC-version and instance fencing remain. Application updates own replacement of their
matched bundled service; an older CLI cannot downgrade a live app's child. Users install the new
desktop explicitly. On macOS and Linux, startup automatically retires verified previous standalone installations
under the native ownership upgrade contract, preserving user data. An occupied service port alone
is never authority to adopt or terminate its current listener.

Existing SDK connections reconnect only to an existing owner. Full Quit cannot be undone by stale
subscriptions or background retries. Fresh explicit demand may launch a new application lifetime.

## Conformance

- One application owner, one service child, one private inference tree.
- No database election, convergence, admitted detachment, or direct production daemon fallback.
- CLI/login/harness starts preserve background intent, even during concurrent launches.
- Window close preserves the tray/service; full Quit retires the owned tree.
- A failed or unresponsive owner is never implicitly killed by a contender.
- Replacement requires exact predecessor cleanup and fresh RPC admission.
