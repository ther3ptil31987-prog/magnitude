# Harness connections

`HarnessConnection` configures an external agent harness to use Magnitude. `Connections` is the
public CLI noun; there is no separate connection-manager domain.

## Pi extension distribution

Normal Pi connections write model/provider configuration and install the shared Magnitude skill.
They do not install, require, upgrade, or remove the Magnitude Pi extension. Existing user packages
remain untouched. A companion source can be explicitly injected by local development tooling or
tests; there is no release-plan default or npm package selection in the connection registry.

## Observation

The shared identifier schema, registry and unavailable-host fallback expose only external harnesses.
An unavailable host supplies no destinations and rejects configuration mutations. Harnesses have one canonical order:

```text
Pi, OpenCode, Hermes, OpenClaw, Codex, Claude Code, Oh My Pi, Cline
```

Detection proves that an external executable is launchable from the host-supplied user `PATH`, excluding
dependency-local binaries. Desktop hosts may resolve a login environment asynchronously; its configuration
roots and command environment are scoped to the connection service, never global process mutations. Installation and connection are independent observations. Connected means
that required Magnitude provider fields, skill contents, and plugin files/activation still exist and
match the connector contract. Receipts alone never imply Connected. Missing or overwritten fields
are Disconnected; unreadable or malformed configuration is Unavailable and is never overwritten
to manufacture a successful connection. Managed disconnected configurations are presented as needing
attention, with their reason and repair/removal actions. Unrelated user fields do not invalidate
a connection. The desktop refreshes this observation after mutations and while the page is observed.
Every verified connection can be explicitly disconnected, including configurations with no manifest
receipt. Without a receipt, disconnect first verifies the Magnitude provider, removes its projection,
and clears its active selection without inventing a previous model or removing unrecorded companion
packages. Managed connections remain disconnectable when required files have changed or disappeared.
Configuration uses each harness's native format and precedence. OpenCode merges its global files
and explicit override; disconnect removes Magnitude from every contributing file. OpenClaw edits
preserve valid JSON5 syntax and unrelated comments.

## Ownership

The user manifest records connection intent, the complete installed Magnitude model descriptors,
optional model-restoration state, and update time. It contains no gateway credential. Descriptors
come from the enriched OpenAI model list and include model identity, presentation, limits,
capabilities, and the exact normalized reasoning domain and default. There is no second
Magnitude-specific model inventory.

Restoration has exactly one uniform field across connectors: `model`, the prior persistent model
selection. Connector-owned provider, endpoint, and catalog projections are removed rather than
stored as restoration state.

Each harness has one connector. A connector owns that harness's:

- Magnitude-specific provider, profile, agent, or catalog projection;
- native active-model representation and restoration;
- reasoning-control projection;
- inference protocol and endpoint;
- skill installation target; and
- read-only configuration inspection.

The shared service owns manifest persistence, installation observation, transactional compensation,
connector dispatch, skill installation, and startup orchestration. It contains no
harness-specific configuration transforms.

A connector may require one harness-native companion package. That package is part of the
connection's desired state rather than an optional setup extra. The connector owns its exact
package identity, source, inspection, installation, activation, and removal operations. The shared
service owns package reconciliation, mutation ordering, compensation, and persistence of package
ownership. A connection records whether Magnitude installed the package or found it pre-existing,
plus a connector-specific validated receipt of any enablement fields Magnitude changed. Disconnect
removes a package only while Magnitude owns its installation; otherwise it conditionally restores
only those fields, never recreating a removed user entry or overwriting subsequent edits. Sync reconciles a
required package as well as connector configuration.

The Pi companion has one desired package source. Production uses its exact versioned npm source;
the repository development launcher supplies the local integration directory instead. The manifest
records the source actually installed. Reconciliation addresses that exact source, replaces a
Magnitude-owned package when the desired source changes, and never replaces a pre-existing
user-owned package merely because development mode is active.

Configuration presence is not proof of package availability. Pi reconciliation verifies the supported
host, installed package version, and extension entrypoint before reporting success. Pi requires
version 0.83.0 or newer for the per-request fetch hook used to observe inference progress. Filters follow
the supported host's native rules, including empty arrays, basename and absolute exclusions, and
autoload-disabled ordering. Relative local sources resolve from Pi's settings directory; explicit
agent-directory overrides govern both configuration and native package commands. An incompatible
borrowed package is reported, not silently replaced. Pi settings fields used by the connector are
schema-validated before mutation; malformed package entries or filters are errors, not absent or
disabled packages. Settings edits preserve unrelated JSONC content, and native-operation recovery
preserves unknown package fields as well as the original string or object entry representation.

Connection mutations hold one cross-process lock through fresh manifest observation, native
operations, configuration, and manifest commit. Process death releases the lock; elapsed time never
transfers ownership. Compensations are registered before mutations, run in reverse order, and all
are attempted even after a recovery failure. Failed operations report incomplete recovery together
with the original error. File recovery checks the value written by the transaction before restoring
it, preserving concurrent edits. Manifest commit is the uninterruptible durability point.

Applying a connection is an idempotent replacement of Magnitude-owned state. Unrelated user state
is preserved. Without an explicit model, connection and sync do not change the harness's current
model or generic reasoning preferences. With an explicit model, the connector records the previous
selection once and persists the Magnitude model used by an ordinary new harness session.

`add` publishes the complete installed model set and may persist a selected model. `sync` refreshes
the model set without launching or changing selection. `remove` deletes Magnitude-owned state and
conditionally restores the prior model only while the current selection remains Magnitude-owned.
Cleanup continues when restoration is unnecessary or unsafe.

Manifest recovery preserves the nearest valid boundary: invalid properties are removed or
defaulted, an invalid connection removes only that connection, and an invalid root is preserved for
diagnosis before resetting to no connections. Valid siblings survive.

## Configuration without launch

Connecting publishes the complete installed-model projection and optional persisted selection.
Desktop onboarding and headless connection commands share this implementation. Neither starts an
external harness, produces a launch plan, or takes ownership of an external terminal. A completed
connection reports any reload or restart the user must perform in an already-running harness.

Connectors preserve canonical model IDs as opaque keys. Claude-facing identities add only the
reserved `anthropic-local/` routing prefix. Provider-local registrations expose every installed
Magnitude model, including callable external Hugging Face models.

The protocol assignments are:

| Protocol | Harnesses |
| --- | --- |
| OpenAI Chat Completions | Pi, Oh My Pi, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Hermes, Cline |
| OpenAI Responses | Codex |
| Anthropic Messages | Claude Code |

## Reasoning-effort correctness

Reasoning validity is model-relative. Magnitude owns each model's exact normalized effort domain
and default. A connector owns the projection between that domain and its harness's native controls;
there is no universal harness control vocabulary.

Harness projection and inference safety are independent obligations:

1. **Precise projection:** every connector must express the model's exact domain and default as
   faithfully as its harness permits. Global admission safety is not permission to publish generic,
   stale, or less precise controls.
2. **Global admission safety:** every locally admitted request applies `RoundUpOrClamp` after model
   resolution. Requests do not carry a trusted harness identity, so correctness cannot depend on
   selecting a harness-specific admission mode.

Projection completeness is normative:

| Harness | Projection | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pi | Complete | Per-model thinking maps govern initial selection, session restoration, and model changes. |
| Oh My Pi | Complete | Native per-model thinking profiles govern selection and model changes. |
| OpenCode | Complete | Reasoning variants are model-relative; an unavailable variant is not serialized. |
| OpenClaw | Complete | Per-model thinking maps resolve agent, session, and model-change state before serialization. |
| Hermes | Best available | A model-agnostic session reasoning value can override per-model configuration. |
| Cline | Best available | Its TUI can select fixed generic efforts outside the model's advertised domain. |
| Codex | Best available | Startup configuration and raw overrides can bypass model-relative catalog validation. |
| Claude Code | Best available | Sticky effort state is generic and gateway discovery cannot publish a per-model effort domain. |

Complete projection means the harness already emits a supported model-specific effort; it is not
another name for rounding. Best-available connectors still publish every exact capability their
harness can represent and persist the most precise safe default available.

At admission, an exact supported effort remains unchanged and omission selects the model default.
`none` is valid only when the model supports disabling reasoning. The
[protocol compatibility design](../inference/http-protocol-compatibility.md) owns the global
`RoundUpOrClamp` admission invariant. The canonical inference request and provider model contract do
not own this wire-compatibility behavior.

## Harness-specific requirements

- **Codex:** install one HTTP and native Responses WebSocket proxy provider named `OpenAI`, using
  Codex's native OpenAI auth, for both bundled and local entries. Its base URL is
  `/inference/v1/proxies/codex`; the gateway routes each request frame by its selected model and
  never translates WebSocket events into SSE. Publish one catalog composed from the installed Codex binary's opaque
  bundled entries plus `magnitude-local/` entries. An explicit selection persists that local alias
  as Codex's ordinary startup model. Sync re-exports the installed binary's catalog without
  changing selection or restoration state. Disconnect removes the proxy provider, preserves a
  newly selected bundled OpenAI model on the built-in provider, clears the owned catalog reference,
  and restores the prior model selection only while the current selection remains Magnitude-owned.
- **Hermes:** publish per-model defaults without changing unrelated global preferences. Session
  precedence still requires the Chat Completions boundary.
- **Cline:** publish its supported OpenAI-compatible provider, exact model metadata, and persistent
  provider/model selection. Its fixed TUI effort surface still requires the Chat Completions
  boundary.
- **Claude Code:** persist the Magnitude gateway settings and selected `anthropic-local/` model, but
  no effort default. Its discovery schema limitation requires the Anthropic boundary.
- **OpenClaw:** publish a dedicated Magnitude agent. Explicit connection selection also updates
  the ordinary global primary with conditional restoration; the user owns session creation.

## Skills and startup

Pi, OpenCode, OpenClaw, Codex, and Oh My Pi share the `~/.agents/skills` target. Hermes,
Claude Code, and Cline use harness-specific user targets. Installation atomically replaces the
selected target's Magnitude skill with the bundled version; shared targets receive one physical
copy.

Startup is an explicit preference to register the desktop owner at login. Connecting a harness does
not implicitly enable login startup or launch the harness. The desktop service supplies the proxy
endpoints; disconnect removes owned settings only while they retain Magnitude's installed values.
An injected service origin governs both generated configuration and read-only inspection; development
profiles use an isolated origin and filesystem root.

The Magnitude skill remains independently installable from a harness companion package. Connecting
Pi installs the skill into its shared agent-skill target and writes model/provider configuration.
Both the headless CLI and desktop submit the same connection request to the shared service.
Normal connections neither install the Pi companion nor modify the user's existing packages.

The following companion behavior applies only when a source is explicitly injected for development
or tests. The extension remains in the repository but is not distributed with desktop releases.

Native Pi package installation also bundles the canonical Magnitude usage skill, using it only when
no skill of that name is already loaded and automatic skills have not been disabled. Loading the
extension does not require the CLI or contact the service. The first eligible fresh interactive
startup offers local-model setup with a Yes/No dialog. Acceptance directly invokes the same setup
action as `/magnitude-setup`: the headless `magnitude app open` command. The desktop owns all
model discovery, installation, and connection steps. Opening it does not certify setup completion,
change Pi's selected model, reload Pi, or suspend its terminal. Pi tells the user to connect Pi in
Magnitude and return to `/reload`. Missing application or CLI installation produces an actionable
error; no terminal onboarding or automatic package installation is retained here.

An exclusive profile-local receipt prevents repeat offers. Existing Magnitude configurations,
conversations, pending work, editor input, command-line prompts, and headless modes suppress the
offer. The explicit command remains available. The development launcher uses the isolated desktop
endpoint and temporary harness profile; finishing the Pi process does not stop the desktop owner.

Existing incompatible or broken CLIs and explicit executable overrides are reported, never silently
replaced. Loading the extension, declining setup, and headless operation do not install software.
The package does not install a private CLI dependency or alter executable lookup. Desktop setup
does not transfer terminal ownership or select a model in the existing Pi session. The user reloads
Pi after connection and selects an installed model through Pi's native model selector. First-run
events retain the already-loaded extension and usage skill; they do not require command-only reload
authority or newer chat-message dispatch APIs.

During a Magnitude request, the Pi companion uses Pi's native working row rather than an extension
footer status. Model loading and prefill temporarily replace the generic working message; generation
is presented as timed work. The companion treats transport requests and a Pi agent run as separate
lifecycles: request progress owns the live row, while `agent_start` through `agent_settled` owns the
retained summary. Completion restores Pi's default working message and presents the model display
name, total agent-run wall time, the first request's time to first token, and token-weighted generation
throughput in one muted, persistent transcript entry below the completed response. Entries remain
in conversation history across subsequent runs and session restoration without entering model context.
Live phase and completed-run durations use whole seconds: `1s` through `59s`, then `1m 0s`,
`1m 1s`, and so on, with unbounded minutes. Below one second, live timers show `0s` and
completed summaries show `<1s`;
TTFT and generation throughput retain their measurement precision. Pi's stock parser decides semantic
success; HTTP EOF alone cannot authorize a summary. Responses and their retry attempts are tracked
independently, including overlapping and delayed observations. Timings are cumulative snapshots;
throughput sums tokens and decode time once for each successful response's final request. Run duration
uses monotonic time. Starting another run, cancellation, failure, switching providers, or extension disposal
cannot erase completed transcript entries. Cancellation and failure do not append successful summaries;
cleanup restores Pi's default working message and prevents late events from appending to another session.

The extension bundles the private SDK and owns one SDK scope, inference observer, and live-row timer.
Model commands use existing RPC against an already-running service and never start the application.
The SDK checks the exact RPC version and instance identity. Development connections use their
explicitly injected package source and retain content-integrity and package-ownership checks.
User-owned packages are not replaced or removed. The retained extension's protocol-mismatch sync
uses that explicit development source; normal desktop connections do not repair or upgrade an
extension. The SDK itself does not own plugin repair or CLI upgrades.

The extension owns its connection and sync commands' scoped lifetimes. Disposing it cancels
pending work; terminal request handles and older runs cannot mutate newer presentation. Presentation
failures do not prevent inference. Installed Magnitude models are selected through Pi's native
`/model` selector; inference requests load the selected model on demand. The extension does not
provide a separate load command or model picker. Its `/stop-model` command uses the existing RPC
without changing Pi's selected model.

The repository exposes one `dev:pi` entrypoint. Both package-first installation and interactive launch
use the user's ambient Pi executable, excluding dependency-local binaries added to PATH by package
runners. It waits up to 30 seconds for an installed Magnitude model to appear, including when initial
status snapshots are ready but empty, then selects it, connects
Pi through the ordinary connection service using the local package source, and launches
Pi with a scoped executable for the current source CLI. Temporary executables live outside the
repository and remain available for the entire child session. This development path exercises the
normal provider configuration and skill installation, plus explicitly requested local companion
installation and loading. Pi's user configuration, connection receipts, and bundled skill are isolated
in the development scope. Pi inherits the caller's working directory: project files and context
remain available, and development setup never substitutes a temporary workspace.
Automatic skill discovery is disabled for this launcher; only the explicit checkout skill is loaded,
including after reload. Changing Pi's agent directory alone does not isolate shared agent skills.
It builds the extension and runs the checkout's inference runtime and suppresses successful
native-build diagnostics while preserving complete failure diagnostics. It inherits the caller's
environment but does not start a telemetry collector or enable tracing itself.
The development launcher explicitly ensures its development Desktop before constructing the
connect-only client. Ordinary CLI and plugin operations cannot launch Desktop. The desktop owns
its service and inference tree independently of the Pi session. Exiting Pi closes
Pi's scoped process and temporary connection resources; it does not stop or replace a separately
owned installed daemon or reconstruct a previous daemon state.

`dev:pi --setup` instead installs only the local package into a fresh temporary Pi profile.
Pi's setup command opens the desktop; it never hosts terminal onboarding. Desktop onboarding
and Connections remain the canonical model-setup and configuration surfaces. The temporary Pi
profile is not implicitly selected by an already-running desktop: connecting that profile must
use its explicit development connection configuration. Source CLI commands inherit the development
connection root, local package source, and isolated configuration/skill paths. This override
never installs a temporary executable as an OS login service. Both modes use the development
app's model store, so acquisition and residency have real disk and memory effects.

## Conformance

A conforming connector must prove that:

- its generated configuration is accepted by the supported harness version;
- every published model remains independently selectable after connection and sync;
- ordinary independent launch uses the persisted Magnitude model when one was explicitly selected;
- sync replaces stale Magnitude model metadata without changing unrelated user state;
- disconnect removes only Magnitude-owned state and conditionally restores selection; and
- required companion packages are reconciled transactionally, user-owned packages survive
  disconnect, and every connection entry accurately records package ownership; and
- explicit development companion connection, sync, source replacement, and removal address the
  recorded source, and the local development entrypoint leaves no repository artifacts; and
- reasoning behavior matches the projection table across startup, persisted state, session override,
  model switching, and direct TUI launch.
