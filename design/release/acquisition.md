# Release acquisition

Runtime acquisition installs only artifacts selected from the version's release manifest.

## Ownership

- The desktop installation exposes its bundled CLI through a Mac symlink, Windows user PATH,
  or the Linux package-owned link. The CLI has no separate npm installation or download.
- The installed desktop application bundles and owns its matching ACN executable. CLI and harness
  demand locate that application; they do not acquire a standalone daemon. Desktop distribution
  validates the application signature and publisher before installation.
- The ICN lifecycle acquires the host's one inference artifact and declares its installation.

These responsibilities do not overlap.

## Integrity and installation

- The manifest is fetched from the configured GitHub release origin over HTTPS.
- Every downloaded artifact must match the manifest byte size and SHA-256.
- Downloads and extraction are bounded. Range responses must identify the exact requested bytes and
  one consistent representation; unsupported ranges fall back to bounded sequential transfer.
- Archives accept regular files only at validated relative paths.
- Installations are addressed by artifact digest and published atomically only after acquisition
  integrity and executable identity are verified. Published cache entries are trusted on subsequent
  launches; a missing executable is a cache miss.
- A valid cached installation remains usable offline. A missing or invalid installation that cannot
  be repaired fails explicitly.

## Inference installation

Each host's release has exactly one inference artifact with every backend of that host. The size
of an inference installation is therefore known exactly before download. Acquisition performs no
pack selection, composition, or capability probe: the installed service selects its device at
runtime from Seismic discovery.

An installation is complete only when its executable, planner inputs and (on Linux and Windows)
NVRTC are present. Its executable's `nativeBuild` identity must match the release record before the
installation is declared; the declaration records only that identity. Acquisition, identity
verification and declaration failures are operational failures.
