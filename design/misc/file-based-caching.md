# File-based cache, index, and durable-state recovery

File-backed derived state is an optimization, never an availability dependency. A cache path is an
optimistic opportunity to reuse work: missing, unreadable, malformed, stale, partially valid, or
unwritable cache data behaves as a cache miss for only the affected recovery unit. It must not crash
the process, fail the user operation, or discard valid siblings.

Durable user state uses the same granular decoding discipline. User intent is not disposable, so
recovery preserves valid choices and, when a damaged source must be replaced wholesale, preserves
the original bytes before installing defaults. Only catastrophic conditions escape the durable-state
boundary as errors.

These guarantees apply equally to Bun/Effect and Rust implementations.

## Data classes and failure boundaries

Every file-backed format must be classified before its persistence behavior is designed:

| Class | Examples | Recovery authority | Cache/file failure visible to caller? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Recomputable cache | model assessment, load timing evidence, remote header, parsed provider catalog | Recompute from authoritative inputs | Never |
| Recomputable index | local-model inventory, session lookup index | Re-enumerate authoritative files or records | Never |
| Durable user state | user preferences with defined defaults | Preserve valid values; default damaged values | Only if recovery is catastrophic |
| Irreplaceable record | session events, user content, credentials | Format-specific durability and repair protocol | Yes; this document's defaulting rules do not apply |

Release artifacts are a separate class from files in a user data directory. Reviewed catalog
declarations and their minimal ID-to-commit lock generate one self-describing planner-input bundle,
which is packaged as an immutable ICN release artifact. Local development constructs the same
installation layout. It is not a user cache: corruption or evidence mismatch is an installation
defect, and deleting
`.magnitude/cache` must never cause catalog metadata or model headers to be reconstructed from the
network during setup.

A file must not mix irreplaceable records with disposable cache data. If a format contains regions
with different recovery authority, split those regions into separate files or make their independent
recovery units explicit. Calling a file an “index” does not make it disposable: it is recomputable
only when all of its facts can be reconstructed from another authority.

A cache boundary is total from its caller's perspective. Its read operation returns a hit, a partial
hit, or a miss; its write operation is best effort. It has no cache-I/O or cache-decode error outcome.
The work required to regenerate a miss retains its own ordinary errors. For example, a corrupt model
metadata cache cannot fail model discovery by itself, but the remote service needed to regenerate
that metadata may independently be unavailable.

## No cache schema versions

Recomputable caches and indexes derive validity from domain evidence rather than a file-format
schema version. Their filenames and decoders are stable across application releases, and evidence
invalidates only the affected recovery unit.

Current decoders instead accept the values they understand, preserve independently valid data, and
default or discard invalid data at the smallest safe boundary. Unknown fields are ignored. A format
change therefore costs, at worst, recomputation of affected entries rather than a whole-cache reset.

Content identities, algorithm fingerprints, native-build fingerprints, and concrete configuration
inputs are not schema versions. They are domain inputs to cache validity and belong in entry keys or
evidence. An evidence mismatch invalidates only the entries whose computed result may have changed.

Durable user state should likewise evolve through tolerant decoding, optional fields, and
defaults rather than a global format-version gate. A missing owned document uses its current
defaults and domain recovery authorities.

The canonical internal model-state document contains a partial map of branded slot IDs to complete
explicit slot selections (`providerId`, `providerModelId`, and `reasoningEffort`) plus
provider-qualified recency and favorites. It contains no serving configuration, bundle, offering
registry, package inventory, assessment, acquisition, recovery marker, or runtime state. An invalid
selection or favorite is removed at that leaf; ACN never guesses missing identity or reasoning.

## Granular recovery

The recovery unit is the smallest independently meaningful value:

- a top-level setting defaults without resetting unrelated settings;
- one map entry can be discarded without discarding other keys;
- one array element can be discarded without discarding other elements;
- one cached property can be recomputed without discarding unrelated properties for the same
  artifact, when those properties have independent evidence;
- an enclosing object is discarded only when a required identity, discriminator, or cross-field
  invariant cannot be recovered safely.

A field with a defined safe default is restored to that default. A malformed optional field is
removed. If defaulting a field would create a misleading or internally inconsistent entity, the
smallest enclosing entity with an independent identity is removed instead. References to missing or
discarded entities are removed or recomputed unless the owning domain defines the complete reference
itself as durable unresolved user intent. In that case it remains present and explicitly unavailable
rather than being silently substituted.

Recovery follows this conceptual flow:

```text
read bounded bytes
       |
       +-- missing / inaccessible / wrong file type ----------> miss or durable-state fallback
       |
       v
parse outer representation
       |
       +-- malformed root ------------------------------------> miss or preserved durable-state reset
       |
       v
decode independent sections, entries, and fields
       |
       +-- valid unit -----------------------------------------> retain
       +-- safely defaultable field ---------------------------> default field
       +-- invalid independent unit ---------------------------> discard unit
       |
       v
validate evidence and cross-field invariants
       |
       +-- stale cache unit -----------------------------------> miss for that unit
       v
return surviving value and regenerate only the misses
```

All external bytes are untrusted. Reads must be bounded. Empty files, random bytes, invalid UTF-8,
truncated JSON, a valid document with the wrong root shape, unknown fields, invalid collection
members, duplicate identities, impossible numeric values, broken references, and stale evidence are
normal recovery inputs, not defects.

## Cache behavior

For caches and recomputable indexes, all filesystem conditions are cache misses at the affected
scope. This includes absence, permission denial, a directory at the expected file path, broken or
unsafe links, concurrent replacement, short reads, decode failure, and resource-limit rejection.

Cache recovery must satisfy all of the following:

- valid siblings remain usable when another field, entry, or section is invalid;
- failure to read, delete, repair, create, encode, write, sync, rename, or lock cache state does not
  fail the operation that wanted to use the cache;
- regeneration may proceed without first repairing or deleting the bad file;
- a successful later write may heal the file atomically, but healing is not required for correctness;
- any diagnostics that are emitted are bounded, omit cached payload contents and secrets, and do
  not become user-facing errors; disposable caches are not required to allocate a recovery report;
- repeated callers may coalesce regeneration in memory, but an in-flight map is not durable state.

Readers cannot assume that writers are cooperative or that a lock was honored. Writers encode the
complete replacement before publication and use a uniquely named temporary file plus a
same-directory atomic rename where the platform supports it. Restrictive permissions and best-effort
temporary-file cleanup still apply. Locking may reduce duplicate work, but correctness comes from
tolerant readers and atomic publication, not from the lock.

Cache deletion and garbage collection are always safe. Size and age policies may remove any entry;
the next access regenerates it. Negative or operational results are cached only when they are stable
domain facts with complete validity evidence; transient failures are never persisted as facts.

Model-assessment entries are keyed by the complete assessment identity: the assessment environment
(engine build, device and its resolved memory bandwidth, normalized stable topology and process
limits, reserve policy and serving configuration), the exact bundle, and the profile with its
performance depths. Live available/free memory is not cached assessment evidence. An absent or unreadable entry is an entry-level miss; readers do not
recognize historical aliases or add a cache-format revision to force invalidation.

Model inventory indexes, content hashes, GGUF inspection, source resolution, package construction,
tensor storage, hardware calibration, model assessment, execution planning, and timing evidence are
all recomputable caches. Completed artifact files and immutable release catalog data are their
authorities. Removing or corrupting any such cache cannot change which artifacts are present,
create or remove a serving configuration, or change durable user intent.

An inventory entry may reuse structural model facts only when its filesystem observation and exact
GGUF/package-validation evidence still match. Template semantics are not inventory evidence. The
template inspector and semantic-policy identities belong to the combined assessment key, so changing
either invalidates affected assessment entries without invalidating physical artifact presence.

## Durable user-state behavior

Durable-state recovery is intentionally more conservative because the valid portions express user
intent:

- a missing user-state document uses the complete default;
- invalid fields, map entries, and array elements recover independently wherever the schema defines
  a safe default or removal behavior;
- unknown fields are preserved when rewriting so a temporarily older binary does not erase settings
  it does not understand; closed owned namespaces such as model selection discard fields outside
  their canonical shape;
- recovery rewrites a normalized file only after the recovered value passes the current complete
  schema and semantic invariants;
- if malformed syntax or an invalid root forces a whole-file reset, the original bytes are preserved
  to a uniquely named recovery copy before the default is published;
- recovery diagnostics identify affected paths without logging sensitive values.

Model selection persistence exposes one addressed update per branded slot, and model preference
persistence exposes one addressed update per provider-qualified model. Neither exposes a serving
configuration write or a second model-only read API. ACN loads the complete model state into one
resident source; each update durably writes the addressed value and then publishes that same state
as one interruption-safe critical section.

The model-state document is a closed owned schema containing only slot selections, recency, and
favorites. Missing optional fields receive their defined defaults. An invalid document is preserved
before the complete default is published. Serving configuration, package, and offering meaning are
resolved continuously from their current authorities and are never repaired into this document.

Catastrophic durable-state conditions are limited to cases where safe recovery cannot be completed:
the current default itself violates the schema, the original authoritative bytes cannot be preserved
before a required whole-file reset, storage access cannot be made safe, or the surviving values
cannot satisfy a security or cross-field invariant without guessing user intent. These failures may
be returned explicitly. A merely missing, malformed, outdated, or partially invalid user-state
document is not catastrophic.

## Shared implementation requirements

Recovery mechanics must be centralized rather than reimplemented by each cache or durable-state
owner.

On the Bun side, the Effect Schema structured-file recovery utility is the common decoding
foundation. Cache adapters wrap it with no-fail semantics: filesystem failures, malformed and
unrecoverable decode results become scoped misses or defaults. Durable-state adapters retain the
richer recovery report, preservation, and catastrophic-error behavior. A cache must not use a
single all-or-nothing decode when its schema contains independent entries.

The Rust side uses Serde and `serde_json`, with the common file mechanics and small recovery
combinators owned by `magnitude-service-utils`. The shared layer provides bounded no-fail reads, object/root
fallback, independent map and array entry decoding, best-effort directory creation, bounded binary
and JSON publication, restrictive temporary files, and same-directory atomic replacement. Cache
callers receive `Option`, an empty/default value, or a hit/miss type without an I/O or decode error
channel.

The schema owner explicitly chooses each recovery boundary. Ordinary Serde decoding is used for a
unit that should be kept or discarded as a whole. `#[serde(default)]` supplies absent values.
`serde_with` adapters such as `DefaultOnError`, `VecSkipError`, and `MapSkipError` may be used when
defaulting an invalid field or skipping an invalid collection member is exactly the desired domain
behavior. An explicit `serde_json::Value` boundary remains preferable when identity validation,
cross-field invariants, unknown-field preservation, or custom recovery decisions are required.

`serde_with` is a convenience, not a required layer in every cache and not an abstraction to wrap or
reimplement in `magnitude-service-utils`. The Rust design deliberately excludes a runtime schema algebra, a
generic recursive schema walker, and automatic mutation-and-retry of arbitrary decode-error paths.
New recovery helpers are added to `magnitude-service-utils` only after the same mechanically correct pattern is
needed by more than one consumer or is required to keep file I/O no-fail.

Disposable-cache reads may silently return misses. A bounded recovery report is optional and is
introduced only where it materially improves operational diagnosis. Durable user state retains
the richer behavior: when recovery changes user-authored data it records affected paths, preserves
unknown fields, and preserves the original before a root reset.

## Conformance tests

The shared file utility is tested with the applicable filesystem and representation cases below;
individual cache/index consumers test their own recovery units and evidence invalidation without
repeating the entire utility matrix:

- missing and empty files;
- random, truncated, and invalidly encoded bytes;
- a valid outer representation with the wrong root type;
- missing, unknown, and wrong-typed fields;
- one invalid map entry or array element surrounded by valid siblings;
- an invalid identity or discriminator requiring removal of its enclosing entry;
- stale evidence for one of several otherwise valid entries;
- an oversized file or collection;
- a directory, broken link, and permission failure at the expected path;
- concurrent reads during replacement and an interrupted write;
- write, rename, cleanup, and lock failure.

Tests assert that valid siblings survive, only affected work is regenerated, cache failures do not
enter the caller's error channel, and failed writes do not change the operation result. Fuzz or
property-based coverage is appropriate for shared parsers that do more than bounded
`serde_json::Value` decoding; it is not required for every thin cache consumer.

Durable-state tests use the same corruption matrix and additionally assert minimal
defaulting, preservation of unknown fields, preservation of original bytes before a root reset, and
explicit failure only for the catastrophic cases defined above.

## Acceptance criteria

- Removing any recomputable cache or index produces, at most, additional work.
- No recomputable cache or index has a file-format schema version.
- Corrupting one independent value does not discard valid siblings.
- Arbitrary cache-file contents and filesystem failures cannot crash the process or fail the user
  operation solely because caching was unavailable.
- Cache validity is established by complete domain evidence, not by file presence or application
  version.
- Durable user state retains valid user intent and defaults only the smallest unsafe subset.
- Bun and Rust use shared recovery facilities with equivalent externally observable guarantees.
