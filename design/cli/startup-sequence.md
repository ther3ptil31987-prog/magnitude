# Headless CLI startup

The CLI is a noninteractive command surface. Commands are finite except foreground `serve`, which
retains application ownership and its service tree until interruption or cooperative Desktop handoff.
Bare invocation prints help. Help, version,
documentation, connection inspection, and status are observational and never start the
application. There is no terminal renderer, onboarding preflight, update prompt, or agent harness.

## Application ownership

`serve` never launches Electron. It acquires the shared native application lock, refuses an existing
owner, excludes active installation, and starts the matched bundled service. Windows requires native
parent-job containment; installed Linux serving retains a close-on-exec shared installation lease.
Headless control reports its owner form, acknowledges Yield before shutdown, rejects login settings,
and never launches Desktop to handle update requests. Terminal service failure exits nonzero after
cleanup; normal stop and Yield exit after complete owned-service retirement. The foreground
command explains a requested stop and explicitly identifies Desktop takeover before shutdown.
The Headless owner retains update preparation and its check schedule for that same lifetime.
Ready notifications explain how to stop and start the server; update installation requests never
interrupt a running server.

Commands validate argument syntax and supported identifiers before connecting. Service-backed
commands require an existing owner and await its compatible Ready service without startup authority.
Absence reports how to open Desktop or run `magnitude serve`; unresponsive control, malformed health,
and protocol mismatch remain errors. Only explicit `magnitude app open` sends ShowWindow; this does
not wait for inference readiness and can open a failed application's Status.

The privileged application client owns installation discovery, launch intent, and local control.
An absent application control endpoint permits a launch attempt. Explicit Open may also launch
Desktop when a Headless owner responds; the new Desktop performs cooperative handoff and Open waits
for a Desktop snapshot. During this already-launched transition, an empty closed control
connection is retried within the existing launch deadline; it cannot trigger another launch.
Malformed replies remain failures. Open never treats the Headless reply as proof that a window opened. A timeout, permission error,
unresponsive owner, or explicit application failure is not absence and must not create another
owner. Concurrent launches coalesce through the desktop native lifetime lock. A cancelled CLI
request does not cancel an application that has already started. Cold startup observes launcher
failure until application control responds. Nonzero launcher exit fails promptly; the Linux
installation guard reports package-manager repair guidance. A successful platform dispatcher may
exit before application admission and is not treated as failure. This short-lived observation
never supervises or terminates the desktop process.

The CLI does not install or download ACN, elect a daemon owner, kill a predecessor, or register an
independent OS daemon. Missing installation and missing graphical session produce actionable errors.
Windows cold launch checks the native assigned desktop; a noninteractive caller may control an
existing desktop owner but cannot create an invisible owner in its own session.
Development uses its isolated desktop, service endpoint, data, and harness configuration.
An explicitly isolated profile also applies to packaged CLI runs: application control, service
requests, and harness configuration use that profile together. Choosing a private profile does
not change whether startup launches a source checkout or an installed application.

## Passive status

`status` observes application lifecycle without starting it. Absence is a successful Stopped result.
The owner is Desktop or Headless when present; tray and login-startup observations appear only for
Desktop. Model observations are separate from service readiness, and unavailable model evidence must
not be presented as no loaded model. Login configuration and application Quit belong to Desktop;
there is no public CLI service administration namespace.

## Recovery and updates

An established SDK connection may reconnect to an available service, but cannot invoke its starter
again. A stale request or subscription therefore cannot undo explicit Quit. Only an explicit application launch may ensure the application again. Startup waits remain bound to the admitted application
occurrence and fail if it is replaced.

CLI update commands delegate to a present application owner independently of service readiness.
They never launch Desktop. Without an owner, status reads saved state and finite preparation holds
maintenance ownership. The CLI does not update itself separately. RPC mismatch gives an update action rather than
replacing or downgrading the running service.
Before a cold installed macOS launch, the host waits for an active native update job targeting that
exact application bundle to finish. An inactive retained job is not an active installation. Observation
failure or a bounded wait expiring fails the command without starting the old application. The CLI
does not stop, replace, or supervise the installer, and warm control requests retain their existing
application semantics.

## Acceptance

- Finite commands terminate without terminal UI or prompts; serve remains until owner shutdown.
- Passive commands neither create a desktop process nor alter login registration.
- Background cold and concurrent launches preserve window visibility and focus.
- Service readiness uses the exact application's compatible service, independent of model loading.
- Cancelling startup leaves an already admitted desktop alive.
- Quit stops the application and its owned tree; established clients cannot resurrect it.
- Installation and login startup never register a standalone daemon.
