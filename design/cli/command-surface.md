# Non-interactive CLI contract

## Scope

The non-interactive CLI is a human-readable, agent-usable projection of Magnitude product state.
It does not expose transport documents or internal state graphs. Bare `magnitude` prints help and
exits. Help, version, and documentation do not start the desktop or service. There is no terminal
onboarding, chat harness, setup command, or hidden hosted-setup mode. All onboarding lives in the
desktop application.

The public command vocabulary is:

```text
update [check | status | download | install | discard]
app open
serve
status
hardware
catalog status | list | show <model-id> | recommendations [--preference <value>] [--limit <count>]
catalog pull <model-id> | cancel <model-id> | remove <model-id>
models status [model-id] | load <model-id> | stop
connections list | add <harness> [--set-model <model-id>] [--install-skill]
connections sync [harness] | remove <harness>
docs [topic-id]
```

Removed output flags are not retained as aliases. The acquisition command remains `catalog pull`,
and there is no JSON mode. Model status, load, and stop are human-oriented commands;
plugins call the SDK over RPC instead.

## Domain ownership

- `serve` owns the foreground application and service tree until shutdown or cooperative Desktop handoff.
- `status` passively reports owner and runtime readiness; tray and login-startup fields appear only for Desktop. With no owner, it prints startup guidance and exits successfully without starting anything.
- `hardware` reports the local inference topology, current memory use, and current allocation.
- `catalog` reports catalog assessment progress, reviewed model choices,
  machine-specific assessment evidence, recommendations, and download operations.
- `models` reports models present or undergoing local operations and controls runtime residency.
- `connections` reports harness installation and observed configuration integrity.

Catalog output never includes acquisition or residency state. Model-status output never includes
catalog ranking or provenance. The focused `models status <model-id>` view is the observation point
for download and load progress.

## Presentation

Comparable collections use borderless tables. Heterogeneous details use labeled fields. Mutations
use concise acknowledgements and include an exact observation command when work continues in the
background. A table that does not fit the terminal becomes labeled row blocks; canonical model and
harness IDs are never truncated.

Output uses friendly names as the primary identity and prints the exact canonical ID whenever an
object can be addressed by another command. Empty state is a successful, explicit sentence. Normal
errors write one actionable product message to stderr and exit nonzero. Redirected output contains
no cursor control, animation, or ANSI dependency.

Normal output excludes ACN/ICN terminology, assessment and environment IDs, package identities,
cache paths, native device indices, source revisions, raw tags, ranking utility, operation IDs,
retryability flags, and stack traces.

Memory uses hardware-conventional units; storage and transfer use decimal units; context uses
compact token counts; generation speed uses `tok/s`. Rounded values are presentation only.

## Client connections

The CLI provides human-oriented commands. Plugins use the private bundled Effect SDK and the
existing RPC endpoint for model observation and control. Both connect to an already-running
Desktop or Headless owner without launching an application. With no owner, service-backed CLI
commands fail with “No Magnitude service is running. Open the Magnitude desktop app or run
`magnitude serve`.” Passive `status` reports absence successfully. There is no model-control JSON
CLI protocol, CLI service starter, or separately published integration-contract package.

## Catalog and recommendation behavior

`catalog status` reports authoritative assessment completion and progress counts when targets are
available. When assessment is incomplete and no targets have been reported, it says so without
inferring a preparation phase or failure reason from the empty count. It does not infer
completion from catalog rows or recommendation availability and does not wait for assessment to
finish. Arbitrary-model discovery is outside the catalog-only product and is not presented.

`catalog list` displays only assessed catalog configurations that fit the current machine. It shows
friendly identity, predicted memory, baseline speed, configured context, speculative acceleration,
and canonical ID. Outstanding or failed assessments are summarized after the useful rows.

`catalog recommendations` reuses the shared onboarding eligibility and ranking policy. Preference
is one of Fastest, Faster, Balanced, Smarter, or Smartest and defaults to Balanced; limit defaults
to ten. Recommendation evidence includes speed, memory, context, intelligence, artifact fidelity,
acceleration, capabilities, and canonical ID. Raw ranking scores and aggregate utility remain
private. The command is a client projection over existing catalog and hardware authorities, not a
second server recommendation authority. Successful nonempty output ends with the exact local
documentation command for interpreting the evidence and ranking methodology.

`catalog show` supplies one model's useful curated and machine-specific evidence.

No catalog or model observation command waits for assessment or residency to settle. Service health
is likewise independent of background assessment.

## Model operations

`catalog pull` converges a catalog model to installed and current. It acknowledges admitted
download or update work and directs the caller to focused model status. Pull, cancel, and removal
validate only model-ID syntax before delegating directly to their authoritative mutations.

`models status` lists curated catalog models when they are on the computer or have relevant
acquisition/removal work. Addressed model commands accept catalog IDs only. One status field applies product priority:
removal, transfer, failures, load/stop, ready, update availability, then unloaded. An optimizing
model reports `Optimizing` with its percentage once tuning is measured. The addressed
form reports installation, transfer or optimization progress, runtime, memory, context, and
actionable failure details without historical or internal operation state.

Load acknowledges admission and prints the focused status command; it never claims readiness from
the load acknowledgement. Load and stop delegate directly to their authoritative mutations. Magnitude has one active local
residency slot, so stop remains unaddressed.

## Connections

Connection observation reports executable installation and configuration integrity separately;
a missing executable cannot hide intact or unreadable configuration.
`Connected` comes from actual configuration and required artifacts, not the durable receipt or executable detection. Connection
mutations delegate directly to the shared connector service. Success reports configuration and
artifact installation. There is no launch-plan or handoff output and no Magnitude harness destination.
Users launch their external harness themselves.

## Conformance

- Every public command and option has useful help.
- Collection ordering is deterministic and every collection has an explicit empty state.
- Addressable rows preserve exact canonical IDs at every terminal width.
- Catalog status preserves the authoritative assessment completion state.
- Recommendations match shared onboarding ranking and memory eligibility.
- No observation command waits for assessment or residency completion.
- Mutation commands acknowledge authoritative completion without adding preflight state
  interpretations.
- Agent documentation directs onboarding to the desktop and documents headless model/configuration commands.
- Tests cover collection, detail, narrow-width, empty, partial, failure, and redirected forms.
- Model commands reject the removed `--json` option before performing any operation.
