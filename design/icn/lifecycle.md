# ICN process lifecycle and Bun boundary

ICN is ACN's sole local-inference runtime. Every ready ACN owns exactly one private ICN child
process. `@magnitudedev/icn-protocol` is the generated wire boundary
for both bootstrap records and the HTTP API. `@magnitudedev/icn` is the authored Effect-native
client integration and lifecycle manager for the child. Lifecycle code resolves and verifies the
native binary, owns the process scope, instantiates one `IcnClient` from the generated client
factory, observes termination, and performs bounded shutdown. ACN consumes that scoped client
directly; a second semantic facade is forbidden unless it owns a new invariant rather than merely
renaming generated operations.

ICN remains inside ACN's owned process tree. On Unix, the process executor places ICN in a separate
process group: its native parent-channel watchdog therefore terminates that entire group on ACN
loss. Each native worker also installs protection before telemetry or backend initialization,
preserving the spawning parent's identity across exec. Leader exit alone never proves group cleanup.
Windows uses nested job containment. Each worker also observes the exact spawning ICN occurrence
through a retained query/synchronization process handle. The launcher supplies PID and creation time;
the worker verifies both before initialization, rejects an already exited parent, and waits on that
same handle in a native thread. Parent exit or observation failure terminates the worker. This grants
no termination rights over ICN and does not replace job containment of descendants. Job handles use
owned native resources, with close-on-drop cleanup across threads and initialization failures.
Native Windows child acquisition supplies the private job and explicit standard-I/O handle list
as process-creation attributes. Containment must exist before child code executes. Retirement
observes both root exit and zero job members through retained handles; a deadline failure retains
those handles and does not authorize a replacement. Environment blocks use Windows ordinal name
comparison, reject duplicate names, preserve inherited per-drive current-directory entries,
and preserve UTF-16 arguments without shell interpretation.
Both measurement and inference workers use this acquisition boundary. Measurement pipes are
transferred through owned Windows handles into Tokio's standard child-stream adapters; dropping the
measurement owner closes its job before disposing of the adapters, so pending pipe reads can finish
on child exit. Inference-worker ownership begins immediately after spawn, before the load
handshake. The engine protocol runs over the worker's standard input and output as blocking
handles; its standard error is drained into ICN's log and a bounded tail accompanies load
failures. Dropping the last engine client closes the transport, and the worker exits.
No independent ICN discovery or durable owner store exists.
Platform child acquisition is a scoped capability supplied by ACN's host composition. It owns exact
process identity, separate standard streams, exit observation and single-flight tree retirement.
ICN's protocol lifecycle consumes that capability without Unix group or Windows job assumptions;
it alone validates bootstrap records and readiness. Child acquisition installs retirement before
becoming interruptible, and readiness failure or scope cancellation retires the acquired child.

The child supervisor exposes one `defineFSM` lifecycle:

```text
Starting -> Ready -> Stopping -> Exited
    |         |          |
    +---------+----------+------> Exited
```

The exact exit observer commits `Exited(code, expected)` before releasing exit waiters. Shutdown is
single-flight and caller interruption cannot abandon it: the winner starts one daemon-owned
terminalization Effect, while all callers await the same result. It sends TERM, waits for the configured deadline, sends KILL, waits for the force deadline, and
reports failure if the owned process group is not proven absent. An already-exited leader does
not bypass that proof. Generic process identity/group inspection lives in shared host utilities,
not in the ACN wire protocol.

ICN is not a separately discovered daemon. Clients never connect to it directly, and ACN does not
adopt an ICN started by another process. A model is not a public process resource: the one ICN
service starts without a loaded model and privately creates or destroys a disposable inference
worker behind model-centric load, replace, and unload operations.

Model assessment is header arithmetic on a bounded blocking pool in the ICN process; it opens no
device. The
private inference worker owns one resident model topology and lives only
for that residency generation. It uses the same verified executable, communicates only with ICN
over private standard I/O, exposes no listener or public lifecycle, and terminates with its
residency or parent. ICN passes its verified installation authority to the worker, which loads the
engine runtime from that exact installation before native initialization, request decoding, or
inference handshake. The installation carries every backend of its host; the engine selects the
execution device at runtime, so there are no separately registered backend modules.
Executable-relative, current-directory, and compiled build-tree discovery cannot satisfy
installed-worker readiness. Explicit development tooling may name
build-tree authority, but it is never inferred by an installed worker. ACN still owns and observes
exactly one ICN service child.

The hardware, assessment, and inventory meanings exposed through this boundary are defined by
[hardware calibration and model assessment](./calibration-model-assessment.md) and
[model catalog and acquisition](../model-management/catalog-and-acquisition.md). This
document defines ownership, process lifetime, transport, and the Bun-facing package contract.

## Ownership boundary

The ICN package owns:

- resolving a release-matched or explicitly configured ICN installation path;
- verifying its build and API compatibility before making it available;
- constructing the model-free server launch configuration;
- spawning exactly one child in an Effect scope;
- obtaining a race-free loopback address and proving that the endpoint belongs to that child;
- readiness, bounded diagnostics, structured child logging, exit observation, and shutdown;
- consuming the generated ICN API without an ICN-specific transport implementation;
- exposing one scoped generated client whose admitted streams preserve their response lifetime; and
- supplying the generated client with the connection established by the managed child lifecycle.

The package owns exact hardware, catalog, discovery, catalog-installation, and instance observation
plus the local provider adaptation because those capabilities compose the one generated ICN client.
It does not own ranking policy, user selection, ACN RPC state, cloud
provider routing, or client presentation. It does not independently inspect hardware or GGUF files
in Bun; it obtains those facts through generated ICN operations. It contains no fallback
implementation of an ICN operation and no hand-written HTTP client, SSE parser, wire schema, or
endpoint-specific transport error mapper.

The native ICN process owns hardware discovery, model acquisition and inventory, artifact
inspection, model assessment, the pinned inference runtime, active-model state, and inference request
execution. `@magnitudedev/icn` acquires the host's one release-manifest inference artifact; ICN is
not downloaded from a model repository or selected from a user-installed runtime.
The installation carries one hardware-independent planner-input bundle. Native startup validates
its structure, manifest and exact catalog coverage before becoming ready. Each exact header is
decompressed and digest-verified before it contributes assessment evidence; release construction
and distribution validation verify the entire bundle before publication. Ordinary startup and setup
therefore do not contact a catalog service, fetch model headers, or depend on a user cache.
Development generation and release CI build it explicitly from immutable catalog revisions;
ordinary TypeScript and Cargo builds perform no catalog network access.

ACN owns the parent scope, application policy, and complete first-party client control plane. It
supplies ICN's storage roots and supported binary identity and translates native observations into
Magnitude-owned catalog, Slot, Instance, environment, ranking, and provider resources. Hardware,
catalog, discovery, catalog-installation, assessment, and instance operations remain native ICN
authorities. Packages and download occurrences are internal implementation details of those direct
operations, not management resources exposed to ACN. The generated contract and event stream are
private to ACN. Only the OpenAI-compatible
`/inference/v1/**` and `/inference/anthropic/**` serving data planes are public; private
`/inference/api/**` management remains inaccessible.

## Generated API boundary

`@magnitudedev/openapi-effect` generates the complete callable Effect API, not merely schemas and
server declarations that require a package-specific wrapper. From one normalized protocol IR it
emits:

- decoded and encoded Effect Schema types;
- server-side `HttpApi` declarations for transports Effect Platform can represent;
- complete operation metadata;
- a typed client whose ordinary operations return `Effect` and whose streaming operations admit
  the response in `Effect` before returning accepted response metadata and an event `Stream`;
- generated client service/tag and construction APIs; and
- a manifest binding every emitted artifact and operation to the source protocol.

The ICN bootstrap protocol comprises non-HTTP records for binary identity, installation
declaration, process readiness and preparation, plus private parent commands. These are canonical serializable Rust
types whose OpenAPI components generate the Effect Schemas consumed by Bun lifecycle, development,
and release tooling. Producers construct the canonical Rust types and TypeScript consumers decode
or encode only through the generated schemas; independently authored wire shapes, compatibility
aliases, parallel public schema surfaces, or unchecked JSON casts are forbidden.

The generator's shared runtime owns request encoding, path/query/header serialization, HTTP
execution, response decoding, SSE and NDJSON framing, declared stream termination and reconnect
policy, response-body cleanup, cancellation, and the common transport/protocol error model. That
runtime is part of `@magnitudedev/openapi-effect`; none of it is recreated in `@magnitudedev/icn`.

The generated client preserves per-operation success and declared error types and groups methods by
the OpenAPI operation groups. It captures `HttpClient` and connection configuration when
constructed so methods require no platform services. Streaming admission failures remain in the
outer `Effect`; only failures after an accepted response inhabit the returned `Stream`. Invalid
local input, transport failure, a declared remote response, an undeclared or malformed response,
and incomplete stream termination remain distinct generated client failures with their actual
response metadata.

Every operation in the normalized IR is emitted into the callable client automatically. There is
no allowlist or hand-maintained facade coverage table. At minimum the ICN contract comprises health
and identity, hardware, catalog, discovery, catalog installation, instances, assessment and load
planning, Hugging Face repository preview, template application, model properties, resource-event
observation, mixed JSON/SSE Chat Completions and Responses, local Anthropic Messages, and
Anthropic token counting. Generator tests
prove that the manifest, descriptors, and callable client contain the same operation set.

The ICN protocol package checks in all generated schemas, operations, server declarations, client,
and manifest from one Rust OpenAPI document. Inside ACN, the authored ICN package exposes
`IcnProcess`, which proves one ready scoped child, and `IcnClient`, which requires that process and
constructs the generated callable API. Public TypeScript and Python clients construct the same
generated contract against ACN's stable proxy instead; they never acquire or authenticate the
private child. No hand-authored model-serving facade duplicates or renames generated operations.
The admitted stream owns its response body until that Stream terminates or is canceled.

ICN also exposes a revisioned model-instance snapshot and coalescing invalidation watch.
The authored ICN package admits the watch before fetching its initial snapshot, refetches on every
newer invalidation, and converges from a fresh invalidation after reconnect. A transient snapshot
failure is retried without abandoning its invalidation, and a terminal watch failure re-admits the
watch before refreshing current state. An explicit exact-instance check preserves refresh failure
instead of authorizing from a cached snapshot. ACN is the only consumer; native instance types
are not a client-facing product mirror. Instance identity, allocation, release, and failure
semantics are defined by
[model instance lifecycle](../model-management/instance-lifecycle.md), not by the hardware API.

Chat's `[DONE]` sentinel and download's successful EOF are OpenAPI extension semantics consumed by
the generator. A stream operation that also declares JSON success content produces both generated
stream and HTTP calls from one operation descriptor family. These are not ICN-specific client
branches.

## Configuration

Launch configuration and model execution configuration are separate.

The launch configuration contains only process-lifetime facts: binary resolution policy, loopback
binding, model-store and cache roots, optional read-only import/source roots, startup and shutdown
deadlines, output bounds, authentication/instance identity, and compatible API/build identity.
It must be validated before spawning.

The model store and disposable cache are separate roots. In the managed product layout, authoritative
model artifacts live under the configured model store root and every Magnitude-owned disposable cache
namespace lives under `.magnitude/cache`; cache implementations must not create private cache roots
beneath the model store. The store root defaults to `.magnitude/models`; `modelsDirectory` in
`config.json` names another absolute directory. ACN reads that setting once when it spawns ICN, so a
change applies at the next service start, and it resolves a symbolically linked root to its real
directory before spawning because ICN refuses a linked root. A relative value, or a path that exists
but is not a directory, is logged and the default applies. Changing the root never moves artifacts;
the previous store remains intact on disk. ICN's managed Hugging Face hub lives beneath the model store, and ICN does not
implicitly discover or adopt a host user's global Hugging Face cache.
External caches or directories participate only when they are supplied explicitly as read-only
import/source roots. ACN resolves the active Hugging Face hub cache from `HF_HUB_CACHE`,
`HUGGINGFACE_HUB_CACHE`, `HF_HOME`, `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, or the platform home default and supplies
that one root explicitly; ICN never discovers another host cache implicitly.

Opening the native model store automatically starts discovery reconciliation. Discovery and model
assessment are background model-domain work: neither delays listener binding, ICN readiness, ACN
readiness, nor health. Their revisioned snapshots explicitly remain provisional while work is in
progress, and model-domain failure does not make the otherwise operational ICN unhealthy.

Per-request context length belongs to an explicit model serving configuration supplied to
assessment and load. ACN resolves that configuration from catalog authority and projects its
provider offering without persisting either. The canonical model ID is callable identity; ICN owns
ephemeral instance identity and residency. Device selection, batching, elastic context state,
projector, and speculative-decoding selection are engine-owned plan resolution beneath ICN; no
fixed sequence slots or physical context allocation appear in the contract. This
separation lets one ICN live for one ACN lifetime while models and configurations change
independently.

Runtime code receives configuration explicitly and uses Effect platform services for command
execution, filesystem/path work, HTTP, clock, randomness, logging, and scope. Core lifecycle code
does not reach directly into Bun globals, Node port-probing APIs, environment variables, or the
user's home directory. A Bun composition layer may translate process environment and packaged
paths into the typed configuration. The managed child disables implicit Hugging Face credentials;
native Hub access may use an explicitly supplied token but never a host login discovered from a
global token file.

ACN-owned ICN shutdown is bounded to one second: ICN receives `SIGTERM` and 500 milliseconds to
exit, then receives `SIGKILL` and has another 500 milliseconds to be reaped. Model loading,
inference, and model-resource release do not extend this deadline.

## Binary resolution and compatibility

Production releases publish one inference artifact per host with every backend of that host
compiled in; there are no accelerator packs. The ICN package shares release-manifest validation,
bounded download, safe extraction, and digest-addressed artifact installation with CLI and SDK
acquisition. It alone owns installation declaration and identity validation. It performs no
eligibility probe, backend selection, or composition: the engine selects the execution device at
runtime, and Seismic discovery is the only authority on whether a device is usable.

An installation is identified by its release artifact and native build. Its fixed layout contains
the executable, `runtime/` (NVRTC on Linux and Windows), the planner-input bundle, and a minimal
declaration `{schemaVersion, nativeBuild}` written by the installer or the local build. There is
no `backends/` directory and no declared backend. Validation proves the executable's
`version --json` identity reports the release's native build and the declaration names the same
native build; `nativeBuild` is the engine build identity (engine version plus kernel bundle
identity).

`bun dev` prepares the same fixed layout at
`inference/target/development/installation.json` before starting the client. `MAGNITUDE_ICN_PATH`
may instead name another `installation.json`; no separate executable or runtime path exists.

Compatibility is established by a versioned ICN API protocol identity plus the release's expected
native build identity. It is not inferred merely because `/health` returned 200, and it need not
require unrelated package semvers to be textually equal. Development installations still enforce
the supported API identity and required capabilities.

## Lifecycle state machine

The lifecycle has the following states:

```text
Resolving -> Starting -> Ready -> Stopping -> Exited
     |          |                    |
     +----------+--------------------+-> StartupFailed / ShutdownFailed

Ready -- unexpected child exit --> DependencyFailed --> ACN termination
```

Only `Ready` publishes `IcnProcess`; only that capability permits construction of `IcnClient`.
The process service exposes immutable child identity and exit observation. Starting, stopping, and
failed states are lifecycle observations and errors, not partially usable clients.

### Startup

Startup is one scoped acquisition:

1. Validate launch configuration, resolve the executable, and verify its identity.
2. Create a fresh opaque instance ID and child-only authorization capability.
3. Spawn `magnitude-inference serve` as a private child with a writable stdin pipe retained by the ACN
   process scope. Before telemetry, native initialization, storage, workers, or HTTP startup, ICN
   installs an EOF guard on that pipe so abrupt ACN loss terminates it immediately.
4. Before spawn acquisition becomes interruptible, construct the complete single-flight
   TERM/KILL/reap shutdown and install it as the one scope finalizer.
5. ICN initializes model-free and binds loopback port zero; Bun must not probe a free port and
   release it before spawn.
6. Consume stdout and stderr through one supervised pipeline. Retain a bounded diagnostic tail and
   forward line-oriented output to structured logs without secrets.
7. Read ICN's machine-readable startup record containing the actual origin, instance ID, process
   identity, API identity, and native build identity. Arbitrary human log text is not a readiness
   protocol.
8. Probe readiness with bounded backoff while racing the child exit and overall startup deadline.
   Validate the instance ID and compatibility fields so an unrelated listener can never satisfy
   readiness.
9. Publish `IcnProcess`, construct `IcnClient` from it, and begin continuous exit supervision.

ICN's HTTP listener is created before it emits the startup record. Its readiness response is
successful only after storage, inventory recovery and API state are usable. After the server
state is constructed, ICN starts inventory discovery and the automatic assessment pool without
awaiting either. The assessment environment is established during startup, beside device
discovery, and a failure to establish it fails startup. Startup retry applies only to
transient connection/unready outcomes. Authentication failure, instance mismatch, incompatible
identity, malformed response, and child exit fail immediately.

Before this acquisition begins, the desktop owner has authorized the exact ACN child to start. Its startup health
reports authoritative base download, accelerator download, installation, and launch activity; byte
progress is present only while artifact bytes are being accepted. It rejects application RPC until
acquisition succeeds. ACN reports `Ready` and admits RPC only after `IcnProcess` and the complete
application layer exist. Concurrent consumers share the same memoized layer and cannot create
additional children.

### Ready lifetime and unexpected exit

The process handle, output fibers, generated client, and request scopes all descend from the same
ICN scope. Dropping an individual HTTP stream cancels and closes that response; it does not stop the
child. Closing the ICN scope cancels every in-flight ICN request before process termination.

There is no automatic in-process ICN restart. If the child exits unexpectedly, ACN has lost a
required authority and must fail closed: the supervisor records the exit status and bounded
diagnostic tail, fails new and in-flight ICN work with a typed dependency failure, and initiates ACN
termination. The external ACN recovery path may then start a fresh ACN/ICN pair. This avoids
preserving provider sessions, model-operation assumptions, or streams across an unannounced native
runtime replacement.

Child exit is considered expected only after scoped shutdown has entered `Stopping`. Exit code zero
before readiness or during `Ready` is still unexpected.

### Shutdown

ACN first closes RPC dispatch and finalizes ICN request producers and observers. Explicit
shutdown and scope finalization use the same cached child terminalization installed as the one
process-scope finalizer. ACN ownership remains held until that operation finishes.

1. Mark ICN stopping so exit is no longer classified as dependency loss.
2. Send the platform's graceful termination signal once.
3. Wait a bounded grace period for ICN to stop accepting work, cancel operations, flush safe
   inventory state, close its listener, and exit.
4. If the deadline expires, send a forceful termination signal, wait a second bounded period, and
   reap the child.
5. Finalize process-output observers and publish the terminal lifecycle result.

The scoped child handle is the complete ownership authority. ICN identity is diagnostic evidence,
not durable process state, and the external ACN manager neither adopts nor directly cleans up ICN.

The native server must handle both interrupt and termination signals with the same idempotent
graceful-shutdown path. Repeated shutdown requests do not send overlapping signal sequences.
Finalization is uninterruptible around signal delivery and child reaping, while both waits remain
bounded. Cleanup errors are logged and classified; they never leave an unobserved child handle.

Signals enter ACN's authoritative lifecycle; they do not call `process.exit` before cleanup. For
managed launch, ICN watches its private stdin pipe from process entry. Orderly ACN shutdown signals
and reaps ICN before closing scope; abrupt ACN loss closes the pipe and ICN terminates its owned group immediately,
including during synchronous native initialization. The EOF wait runs on a detached OS thread, not
Tokio's blocking pool. This is a private child-lifetime channel, not admission, discovery, adoption,
or sharing.
On Windows, orderly shutdown sends the canonical newline-delimited Shutdown command over retained
stdin and waits the configured grace interval before forced job retirement. The same shutdown path
closes listener admission as an OS signal. The lifetime thread keeps watching after Shutdown;
EOF, invalid framing or malformed commands still terminate immediately independently of Tokio.
Frames are bounded to 256 bytes. Repeated valid Shutdown commands are idempotent, and a request
received during initialization remains pending for orderly shutdown. The parent always proves the
complete nested job retired, even when the root exits successfully within the grace period.

## Model instance lifecycle

The singleton starts with no model instances. Catalog, discovery, assessment, catalog installation,
and deletion remain available in that state. ICN's `ModelInstanceController` owns
physical instance admission, native workers, backends, exact-instance leases, lifecycle
publication, and terminal cleanup. ACN owns product slots as durable selection only. A slot is not
an ICN resource and carries no physical lifecycle.

Explicit load accepts a canonical model ID and options. ICN resolves the serving configuration,
creates the Instance identity, and admits it through the same residency coordinator used by
inference. The load is admitted by the engine's preview on ICN's device catalog, which names the
device and the startup memory claim; the worker loads exactly that device and its own startup
claims are the authoritative admission. There is no parallel-sequence search or fixed-slot
allocation.
Load does not accept a planner name, planner version, capacity-policy identifier, or native flags.
ICN publishes typed Instance progress through loading and ready or failed termination. Loading
reports a stage and a fraction measured from the worker's tuning and weight import after prior
residency is released (see `design/model-management/instance-lifecycle.md`); the fraction is
monotonic, and only Ready means complete. Loading, its stage and fraction,
Ready, Stopping, Stopped, and Failed are published in the revisioned
`ModelInstancesSnapshot`. Equivalent concurrent demand joins the same admitted load and receives
the ICN-created Instance; a later load after terminalization uses a new identity. Concurrent
incompatible mutations are serialized by `ModelInstanceController`; they
never rely on ACN-side locking. Ready state carries the serving context and the engine's
per-domain allocation census. Hardware snapshots do not own that evidence.
Each resident load creates one private `inference-worker` child running the engine's worker: it
opens its own device catalog, loads exactly one model on the device it is given, and owns the
device, weights, state and scheduler until it exits. ICN keeps the model's chat semantics and
reaches the worker only through the engine's versioned framed protocol with per-request output
credit; both ends must be the same engine build. A catalog installation's optimization runs the
same inference worker with a prepare-only request that tunes into the kernel cache and exits
without becoming an Instance. Worker kinds receive native-runtime authority
from the same immutable worker-launch capability.

ICN resolves the model once, device-free, and gives the worker the resulting execution manifest
with the exact device selector its preview chose, its kernel cache directory and its reserve
policy. The worker re-resolves that selector in its own catalog and rejects a missing or ambiguous
match; readiness reports the package identity, device and allocation census ICN verifies and
publishes.

Inference-worker lifetime is subordinate to ICN even on abrupt failure. Unix children disable
core dumps and run a dedicated process-parent-liveness watchdog. Retirement of a thread that
spawned a worker cannot terminate that worker while its owning ICN process remains alive. Windows
workers enter a kill-on-close Job Object during process creation. The retained child
or Job handle, rather than a later PID lookup, performs forced termination and reaping.

An ordinary inference request names only the canonical model ID. ICN validates installation, joins
or admits residency, and atomically grants `ModelInstanceLease` when the resolved target is Ready.
It holds the lease until the response stream succeeds, fails, or is canceled. Readiness and lease
grant occur under the same transition authority, so idle release, Stop, or replacement cannot
create a pre-stream not-ready race. Chat Completions, Responses, local Anthropic Messages, and explicit warm load share this
coordinator; ACN performs no preparation or load-before-inference step.

`ModelInstancesSnapshot` is authoritative lifecycle. ACN observes it privately and projects
per-model residency into its catalog rows and resolved Slot states; first-party clients read
those ACN resources and never see native instance identities. Explicit Stop and autonomous ICN
release therefore appear through the same native observation path regardless of whether demand
came from the agent, CLI, Python, or a third-party harness.

Replacing a model must not claim the new model is ready until its backend is usable. Failure leaves
the model instance in an explicitly reported state and must not make requests route to a
half-loaded backend. One Stop endpoint accepts only the exact model-instance identity. During
loading it cancels and cleans partial resources; after readiness it closes mutation admission,
terminates active worker requests, and releases native resources. Stop is idempotent for an
ended identity and cannot affect a newer occurrence of the same configuration. Chat requests bind
to the active native generation they began with and cannot silently continue on a replacement.

Every request joined to a Loading occurrence observes exact-instance Stop as the canonical
non-retryable `model_instance_stopped` condition. Once semantic streaming begins, explicit Stop
closes admission, terminates active worker requests with the same condition, and then releases the
instance. The provider adapter presents either occurrence as `ModelInstanceStopped`. Replacement
and idle release retain graceful lease drain.

Every inference request holds an exact model-instance lease through stream end or cancellation.
Explicit load, replacement, and Stop share controller mutation authority. Stop and replacement
close new inference admission. Replacement waits for existing leases to drain; explicit Stop
terminates those requests. Memory-pressure
eviction is deliberately different. The engine releases memory itself and unloads when other
programs hold system headroom at or below its planning reserve. Persistent ICN is the independent
guard: it observes limit-bounded system-RAM headroom through Seismic every 100 milliseconds while
a worker is resident and every second otherwise, and kills the inference worker on the first sample
at or below the emergency reserve. Either path publishes `memory_pressure` and closes load
admission until headroom has stayed above the planning reserve for five seconds; a failed sample
restarts that interval. Eviction does not wait for leases or native cleanup. Worker exit, protocol
loss, or one continuous second of unavailable memory supervision terminalizes the affected
instance and fails its streams without terminating persistent ICN. There is no automatic reload.

ICN's pinned runtime is part of the ICN build, so ACN has no separate native-runtime install,
discovery, refresh, instance registry, endpoint lease, or selection lifecycle.

## Failure semantics

The lifecycle error channel is a union of existing upstream typed errors and semantic ICN tagged
errors. Filesystem, command, schema, generated-client, and release-installation errors propagate
unchanged. The lifecycle creates a new tagged error only when it discovers a new domain fact, such
as an absent or non-executable binary, incompatible identity, bounded timeout, non-loopback origin,
premature exit, or unexpected exit.

Each lifecycle tag names one failure variant and carries only the facts belonging to that variant.
Human messages are derived from those facts. There is no generic phase/reason/message/diagnostic
envelope and no wrapper whose primary payload is another error. Bounded native output is owned only
by variants for which process output is relevant, including startup timeout and process exit.

Every failed startup cause commits `Stopping(startup-failed)` before it propagates. Typed failures
remain their original typed errors, and defects remain defects; neither can leave readiness waiters
blocked behind a lifecycle state that still claims startup is in progress. The complete cause is
logged once at the startup boundary, and the ACN process exits unsuccessfully. Scoped finalizers
independently guarantee cleanup.

Generated client failures distinguish invalid local input, transport failure, a declared remote
failure, undeclared or invalid response, incomplete stream, and cancellation. Declared ICN error
bodies retain their generated type; common failure metadata preserves operation ID and HTTP status.
Lifecycle unavailability/stopping is separate from HTTP protocol failure. Secrets, full model
prompts, authorization values, and unbounded native output are never attached.

Domain results remain values. In particular, `DoesNotFit`, a download `Failed` terminal event, a
safe deletion refusal, and a model load failure reported by the operation contract are not
misclassified as broken HTTP transport. Defects are reserved for violated internal invariants;
expected command, filesystem, HTTP, schema, timeout, signal, and child-exit outcomes remain in
typed Effect error channels.

## Observability

Every child has stable ACN and ICN instance correlation fields. Startup, readiness, requests,
stream termination, unexpected exit, and shutdown create Effect spans and structured logs. Child
stdout/stderr is bounded, line-framed, level-mapped where possible, and correlated with its PID and
instance ID. A diagnostic tail is retained for failures without becoming an unbounded in-memory
log store.

Health, inventory, and hardware observation do not affect ACN process presence. Session-generation
ownership covers continuing agent work; ICN backend leases cover native admission and response
streams. These are local resource lifetimes, not process-global activity or demand.

## Conformance criteria

The lifecycle conforms when:

- one ready ACN has exactly one owned ICN child and no reusable/discoverable ICN daemon;
- ACN process admission precedes ICN scope acquisition, and no ICN identity is added to durable ACN
  process state;
- managed ICN observes its private parent pipe before expensive initialization and exits if the ACN
  disappears;
- constructing `IcnClient` without `IcnProcess` is impossible in the Effect dependency graph;
- ACN cannot become ready when its ICN binary is absent, incompatible, or unready;
- launch is model-free and changing the active model never replaces the ICN process;
- ICN readiness never waits for measurement; the assessment pool is `Preparing` until its basis exists;
- loopback binding has no probe-then-bind race and readiness proves child instance identity;
- every bootstrap record produced by ICN is accepted by its generated Bun schema, and generated
  contract drift fails validation;
- every normalized OpenAPI operation appears automatically in the generated callable client;
- `@magnitudedev/icn` contains no hand-written streaming transport logic or redundant runtime
  facade;
- ACN contains no ICN command service, mutation proxy, or mirror-copy service;
- no Bun implementation duplicates hardware, model inspection, assessment, downloading, inventory, or
  pinned-runtime management;
- the public local provider ID is exactly `local`, and its bound model streams through the scoped
  ordinary generated chat client rather than an endpoint URL adapter;
- Chat, Responses, and local Anthropic Messages resolve a canonical model ID, join or admit residency, and lease the exact
  Ready Instance through one ICN-owned coordinator;
- explicit warm load uses that same coordinator; explicit stopping resolves the exact Instance ID
  inside ACN from slot-addressed commands;
- `ModelInstancesSnapshot` owns lifecycle; ACN projects it into catalog-row and Slot residency
  without becoming the authority for the native resource;
- loading one local model terminalizes the prior instance before the replacement becomes Ready;
- a resident model remains loaded until its fixed one-hour zero-inference-lease deadline expires, explicit
  replacement, exact-instance Stop, memory-pressure eviction, inference-worker loss, or ICN
  process exit;
- replacement, load, and Stop serialize through native mutation authority and cannot
  invalidate an admitted inference lease;
- stopping a Loading instance ends every joined preparation waiter without retry or automatic
  replacement, while stopping a Ready instance terminates active execution streams;
- product model-download, activation, deletion, hardware, and assessment operations reach ICN only through
  the generated client, with no alternate model-repository or host-inspection path in ACN;
- interrupting a consumer stream closes its response without terminating ICN;
- an unexpected ICN service exit causes the owning ACN to fail closed without an in-process
  restart; an internal inference-worker exit unloads only its runtime generation and leaves ICN
  available;
- normal ACN shutdown cancels higher-level work, gives ICN only a short graceful termination window,
  escalates on deadline, and reaps it;
- termination and interrupt signals both activate native graceful shutdown;
- abrupt ACN death at any point after managed ICN spawn cannot leave an ICN indefinitely orphaned;
- lifecycle and transport failures remain typed and retain bounded, redacted diagnostics; and
- generated-artifact checks, package tests, native signal tests, and release smoke tests prove the
  shipped ACN and ICN identities are compatible; candidate validation additionally requires local
  model preparation to complete through the packaged resident planner.
